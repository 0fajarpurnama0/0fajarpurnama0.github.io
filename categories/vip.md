## Dynamic Services
As I am low on budget, I cannot purchase domains. As my contents maybe controversial, they are very vulnerable to censorship. I believe [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/?ref=faj135) to be fast in keeping up with these technologies. However, if you still cannot access, then you may want to install extensions to access my special contents:

- [Unstoppable Domains Extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension)
- [Peer Name Extension or others that supports .bit, .lib, .coin, .bazar, .emc, .onion, .tor domain names](https://peername.org/)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)
- [TOR](https://0fajarpurnama0.github.io/internet/2020/04/25/bypass-censorship-tor)
- [Torrent](https://0fajarpurnama0.github.io/tools/2022/12/04/webtorrent-widget.html)
