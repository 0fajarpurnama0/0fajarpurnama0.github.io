From the brain storming with you from another conversation, we have lock a fan fiction plan for Legend of Dragoon.


My answers:


***

How about I do not know about them?


1. Attemp to stop Rose Black Monster.

2. In the middle of the fight, sensed even greater evil far away as Zieg on the way attempting to use Dragoon Spirit releasing Melbu Frahma.

3. Leave Rose Black Monster and Rushed to Zieg.

4. Saved Claire from possesed Zieg's attack and Zieg escaped leaving the Red Eyed Dragoon Spirit behind.

5. Dart's and Claire's journey will be about finding Zieg who disappears and investigate Black Monster because destroyed their hometown Neet.


Good but I prefer to revise that the canon is still more exciting:


- Melbu Frahma does not need Dragoon Spirit and proceeds with canon plan disguising himself as Diaz.

- Me and anybody else does not know about Dragoon Spirit so I just give the stone to Dart and let proceed as canon.

- Dart in canon is pursuing revenge against Black Monster but here Dart and Claire will also pursue Black Monster but with different goal to find Zieg.

Your Summary:

***

Great. I have locked this narrative down.

Here is the summary of the Legend of Dragoon fan fiction plan we have built:

Fan Fiction Plan: The Legend of Dragoon

Route: Narrative 1 (The Hidden Master)

State: State 3 (Normal Human, Knowledge & Grind).

Role: Mentor/Grandmaster (A contemporary of Haschel and Zieg).

The Premise:

* The Departure: You arrive in the world ~20 years before the game. You are a Martial Artist cultivating your own path (likely mixing Rouge School style with Internal Cultivation).

* The Neet Incident: You intervene during the Black Monster's attack.

* You save Claire (Dart's mother).

* You witness Zieg being possessed by Melbu Frahma.

* Zieg vanishes, leaving the Red-Eye Dragoon Spirit behind.

* You rescue Claire and the baby Dart, taking the Spirit as a memento.

* The "Black Box" Approach: You do not know the full lore (Melbu's plan). You simply know Zieg is "lost/possessed" and the Black Monster is involved.

The Main Story:

* Dart’s Upbringing: Raised by You and Claire. He is less angst-ridden, more disciplined, but driven by the mystery of his father's disappearance.

* The Spirit: You give the stone to Dart. He resonates with it naturally (Canon timeline preserved).

* The Motivation: The journey is not just about revenge; it is a search mission. "Where is Zieg?"

* Lavitz's Fate: Lavitz is critically wounded (dantian shattered) but saved from death. He and Albert share the Jade Dragoon Spirit (Albert casts, Lavitz fights, or they switch).

* The Reveal: The party discovers "Emperor Diaz" is Zieg. The final goal shifts from "Kill the God" to "Exorcise the God to save the Father."

We have covered a lot of ground today!

This conversation will be dedicated in writing legend of dragoon fan fiction. Use narrative development life cycle. Start with the first phase of NDLC.

---

**Gemini:**
This is an excellent way to approach a long-form story. By applying a Narrative Development Life Cycle (NDLC), we ensure the story has strong structural integrity before we start writing the prose.

We are beginning Phase 1: Concept Definition & Character Profiling.

In this phase, we need to flesh out the specific details of your character, the modified dynamics of the cast, and the logic of the world based on the changes we made. This serves as the "Story Bible."

Here is the breakdown for Phase 1. Please review and answer the questions in the "Input Needed" sections.

NDLC Phase 1: Concept & Character Construction
1. The Protagonist (You)

You are the anchor that changes history. To fit the lore, you must be powerful enough to stand alongside Zieg and Haschel, but grounded enough to not overshadow Dart later.

Archetype: The Wandering Grandmaster / The Hidden Guardian.

Age: Roughly the same generation as Haschel and Zieg. (At the start of the game/canon era, you would be in your 50s or 60s, though perhaps internal cultivation keeps you youthful).

Fighting Style: You mentioned mixing Rouge School (Haschel's style) with Internal Cultivation (Chi/Ki). This suggests you are a heavy hitter who uses speed and energy projection.

Knowledge Level: Limited. You know Zieg was possessed and Rose (Black Monster) attacked. You do not know about the Virage Embryo, the Moon Child, or Melbu Frahma's grand historical plan.

Input Needed:

Name: What shall we call your character?

Relation to Zieg: Were you a friendly rival? A sworn brother? Or a stranger who happened to be there?

Weapon: Do you use bare hands (like Haschel), a staff, a sword, or something else?

2. The Survivor: Claire

Since Claire survives, Dart’s psychology changes. He is not an orphan.

Role: The Anchor. She keeps Dart grounded. She likely suffers from PTSD regarding Neet, but she is strong.

Relationship to You: You saved her life. Over the last 18 years, have you acted as a distant guardian living next door, or an adoptive uncle/father figure living in the same house?

Location: Did you return to Seles (Dart’s canon starting village) to hide, or did you settle somewhere else? (Returning to Seles fits the canon start best).

3. The Protagonist: Dart

Dart is no longer fueled purely by the trauma of being an orphan, but by the mystery of his father.

Personality Shift: Canon Dart is reckless and hot-headed. This Dart, raised by a Grandmaster and his Mother, should be more disciplined. He is still eager and brave, but perhaps more tactical.

The Stone: You have held the Red-Eye Dragoon Spirit for 18 years.

The Handoff: In canon, Dart finds it. Here, you must give it to him. Why now? Is it because the monsters are attacking Seles, or because he has finally come of age?

4. The Antagonist: Possessed Zieg (Melbu/Diaz)

We need to clarify the "Neet Incident" logic.

The Event: 18 years ago, Zieg (already a Dragoon) fights Rose.

The Twist: Melbu Frahma (spirit) seizes the opportunity to possess Zieg.

The Drop: Why did he leave the Dragoon Spirit behind?

Theory A: The Dragoon Spirit resisted the possession (it is a chaotic force, perhaps it rejected Melbu), so Melbu discarded it.

Theory B: Melbu was arrogant and felt he didn't need a "petty dragon's power" now that he had a physical host.

Current Plan: We will go with Theory B unless you object. It highlights Melbu's arrogance.

5. The Opening Sequence Outline (Preview)

Once we finish Phase 1, we will move to outlining. The story will likely start In Media Res or with a flashback.

Prologue: The Night of Neet. The fight, the possession, the rescue.

Chapter 1: 18 Years Later. Seles. Training Dart. The Feyrbrand/Sandora soldiers attack.

The Departure: Seles is destroyed (or damaged). Shana is taken. You give Dart the stone. The journey begins.

Your Turn

To complete Phase 1, please provide the details for the Input Needed section regarding your character (Name, Weapon, Relation to Zieg).

Once you give me those details, I will compile the Final Profile and we will move to Phase 2: The Arc Outline.
