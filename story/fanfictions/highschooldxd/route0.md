## 📅 **Route 0: The Prologue**

**Date:** Sunday Evening
**Location:** 2LDK Apartment, Kuoh Town.

The cardboard boxes are still half-packed. My parents are in the other room, arguing softly about the logistics of their Ph.D. research. It’s the same old noise. They are brilliant, busy, and always moving.

I looked at the calendar on my phone. **Three weeks.**

That’s the hard limit. Due to a visa complication and the abrupt nature of my father’s research grant ending, I only have three weeks in this Japanese high school before we have to move back to our home country.

Three weeks to experience the "Youth" I felt I missed out on back home.

I looked in the mirror. Just a guy. Not ugly, but not striking. Average build. A bit stiff in the shoulders. I took a deep breath, trying to apply what I’d read about **Bio-Feedback**. I forced my shoulders to drop, trying to manually lower my heart rate.

*“Don't be the invisible guy this time,”* I told my reflection. *“Just... make a memory. Any memory.”*

## 📅 **Route 0: Day 0**

**Date:** Monday Morning
**Location:** Kuoh Academy, Class 2-B.

**08:30 AM - The Introduction**

The uniform felt tight around the collar. Kuoh Academy was formerly an all-girls school, and you could tell. The ratio was skewed. The hallways smelled of perfume and expensive shampoo. For a guy who spent his teenage years burying his head in books and video games to avoid eye contact, this was a battlefield.

I stood at the front of the class.

"Everyone, we have a short-term exchange student," the teacher announced, sounding bored. "Please welcome Fajar Purnama."

I bowed. 45 degrees. Textbooks said 45 degrees was polite. "Nice to meet you. I... I hope we can get along for the short time I am here."

Polite applause. Scattered whispers. I scanned the room.

There were the "Normal" students. And then, there were the *others*.
A blonde boy with a smile that felt too perfect (Kiba). A small, white-haired girl eating snacks who looked like she could bench press a truck (Koneko).

And then, sitting near the window, a brown-haired guy who looked like he was vibrating with restless energy.

**12:15 PM - The Lunchroom Alliance**

I didn't want to eat alone. That was the old me. The new me had to be brave.

I saw the brown-haired guy from class sitting with two others—a guy with glasses and a shaved-head guy. They were arguing loudly. The rest of the cafeteria seemed to have drawn an invisible "Do Not Enter" circle around them.

*Perfect,* I thought. *Outcasts.*

I walked over with my tray. "Is this seat taken?"

The three of them stopped talking. The glasses guy (Motohama) adjusted his frames. The bald one (Matsuda) squinted.

The brown-haired guy—**Hyoudou Issei**—grinned. It was a stupid, wide, honest grin. "Fresh meat! You got guts sitting with the Perverted Trio, transfer student!"

"Perverted Trio?" I blinked. "Is that an official club name?"

They laughed. It wasn't malicious. It was the laughter of guys who knew they were at the bottom of the food chain and didn't care.

"I'm Issei. That's Matsuda and Motohama," Issei pointed with his chopstick. "We're discussing the most important topic in the universe."

"Which is?"

"Why the kendo club girls wear spats under their hakama," Matsuda said with dead seriousness.

I sighed, but I sat down. It wasn't the intellectual conversation my parents would want me to have, but it was *conversation*.

**15:30 PM - The Vibe**

As I walked home with them (they insisted on showing me the "best route," which suspiciously went past the tennis courts), I felt it.

A strange... pressure.

It came from the Old School Building on the hill. Every time I looked at it, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. It triggered my **Sensory Overclocking** practice without me trying. The air felt heavier there, thicker.

"Scary place, huh?" Issei noticed me staring. "That's the Occult Research Club. Rias Gremory runs it. She's... well, she's top tier."

"Rias Gremory," I repeated the name. It felt heavy on my tongue. Like a name I shouldn't say too loud.

I looked at Issei. For a second, just a split second, the shadow stretching out from his feet looked wrong. It looked jagged. Like a wing.

I shook my head. *Focus, Fajar. You're just tired. Stick to the training.*

"Hey, Fajar!" Issei slapped my back, nearly knocking the wind out of me. "You busy tonight? We're planning something big for tomorrow morning. Operation: Peeping Tom. You in?"

The old me would have run away.
The moral part of me wanted to lecture them.
But the lonely part of me? The part that knew I was leaving in three weeks and might never see these idiots again?

"I... I'll come watch," I said. "But I'm not peeping. I'm just... observing the environment."

"That's the spirit!" Issei cheered.

**22:00 PM - The Night Routine**

Back in my room. I felt exhausted, but not physically. Socially.

I sat on the floor, legs crossed.
**Module 4: Mental Reset.**

I closed my eyes. I visualized the day. The noise of the cafeteria. Issei's weirdly intense energy. The ominous feeling of the Old School Building.

I breathed in. *I am here.*
I breathed out. *I am normal.*

I have three weeks. I don't know why, but I feel like if I don't survive these three weeks... I'll lose something more important than just time.

I laid down to sleep. Tomorrow is Monday. The real schedule begins.
