Let's move on to exploring Boruto time reset. We have made Naruto, Sasuke, and Kurama time reset in 3 possible scenarios where first was canon route during their childhood future memories retained, second was during infant to be able to save the uchiha, and third Kurama returned first to save Kushina and Minato. This time the world in Boruto became too tangled and corrupted due to many dimensional travel where in the end we as admin are in from of teen Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari briefing ready to reset the world:


- Rather than letting reset naturally, why not make things better since it is a reset and not different timelines.

- Ideally just revive everyone there is but we do not have that ability yet.

- The five here now Boruto with Momonoshiki inside, Himawari with puppy Kurama inside, and Sarada can exist before their time but remain ageless until their era begins.

- The latest to survive are able to retain their memories where in order who will remember from early to last other than these 5 are Kurama during Minato and Kushina final moments, Naruto Sasuke Hinata and Sakura when they are 4 years old, and finally Kakashi during bell training first time with team 7.

- We can go back as far as team Minato. Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari, why not save Obito and Rin. Then next event have mini Kurama knock big Kurama when this time Madara from the shadow releases big Kurama from Kushina to return his memory and propose split 3 chakras into Naruto, Minato, and Kushina. Then save the Uchiha clan, and so on.

- Boruto is teen almost a full Otsuki with cooperative Momonoshiki, Sarada awakened Magekyo Sharingan, and Himawari with little Kurama currently. However, their age and powers will be reverted to genin or when they are childrens. They can grow stronger but will remain childrens until their era comes.

- No restriction in revealing identity. Some may believe but most will call it crazy. So just be realistic.

- This is the extend of our powers, will begin the reset.

**Gemini:**
This is a fascinating and complex "New Game+" scenario. The psychological weight on Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari is immense—they essentially become "Time Watchers" or "Ghosts of the Leaf," living through history without aging, waiting for their parents to be born and grow up.

Here is the simulation of Project: Spiral Roots.

The White Room: The Briefing

Ren (Admin): "The dimensional integrity of World-77 is at 3%. Too many Otsutsuki incursions, too many time slips. The narrative yarn is knotted beyond repair. We are initiating a hard reset."

Ren: "Boruto, Sarada, Himawari. You three are the anchors. We are sending you back to the fracture point: The Third Great Ninja War. You will retain your memories, your skills, and your tenants (Momoshiki and Baby Kurama). However, your physical bodies will be reverted to children (approx. 10-12 years old). You will not age physically until the timeline catches up to your original birth era. You are to be the guardians of history."

Boruto (adjusting his headband): "So we're stuck as brats for thirty years? Momoshiki is going to complain the whole time."
Momoshiki (Spectral form): "Hmph. Observing the primitives might be amusing for a decade or two."

Sarada (checking her eyes): "We save Obito. We save the Fourth. We prevent the Uchiha Massacre. And we wait for our dads to wake up."

Himawari (petting the small fox on her shoulder): "And I have to make sure Big Kurama doesn't kill Mom and Dad. Ready, Kurama?"
Mini-Kurama: "Let's go teach my younger, angrier self some manners."

Ren: "Beginning Transfer."

Checkpoint 1: The Kannabi Bridge (Year: War Arc)

Location: The crumbling cave.
Status: Critical. Kakashi has lost an eye. The rock is falling toward Obito.

The timeline expects Obito to be crushed. Instead, a blur of yellow lightning—not Minato—flashes.

Boruto appears, spinning a Vanishing Rasengan that disintegrates the falling boulder into dust before it touches Obito.

Kakashi (Young): "Who...?!"
Obito: " I... I'm alive?"

Sarada lands in front of the Iwagakure reinforcements. She activates her Mangekyo Sharingan. The sheer pressure of her ocular jutsu freezes the enemy jonin.
Sarada: "Fire Style: Great Fireball Jutsu." (The scale is that of an adult Madara, dwarfing the canyon).

Minato Namikaze arrives seconds later, expecting the worst, only to find three strange children protecting his students. He sees the Rasengan in Boruto’s hand. He sees the Uchiha crest on Sarada.

Minato: "That technique... and those eyes. You aren't from Iwa."
Boruto: "Yo, Fourth Hokage. We're... let's just say we're distant relatives. We're here to fix a mistake."

Result: Obito Uchiha is saved. He does not meet Madara. Rin is never kidnapped to be a jinchuriki. The chain of hatred breaks early.

Checkpoint 2: The Night of Tragedy (October 10th)

Location: Secret Cave outside Konoha.
Status: Kushina is in labor.

Because Obito is still a loyal leaf shinobi, he is not the masked man. However, Madara Uchiha (Elder), realizing his pawn has failed, utilizes Black Zetsu to forcefully weaken the seal from the shadows.

The Nine-Tails is extracted. It roars, mindless with rage, ready to crush Minato and Kushina.

Himawari steps out from the bushes. She looks tiny against the Tailed Beast.
Himawari: "Sit, Kurama!"

The Mini-Kurama pops out of Himawari, growing to a respectable size (though smaller than the actual Nine-Tails). He jumps onto the giant snout of the rampaging Nine-Tails.

Mini-Kurama: "Oi! You big idiot! Snap out of it!"
Big Kurama (Raging): "WHO ARE YOU?! A FRAGMENT?!"
Mini-Kurama: "I am you, from a future where we aren't stupid enough to kill the only humans who actually tolerated us. Look!"

Himawari touches the giant beast. Memory Transfer Initiated.
The Big Kurama sees it all: Naruto, the fist bumps, the Baryon Mode, the sacrifice, the family. The rage evaporates, replaced by confusion and a deep, grumbling sorrow.

Big Kurama: "Minato... Namikaze..."

Minato, holding a dying Kushina, prepares the Reaper Death Seal.
Big Kurama: "Put that away, Fourth. I'm not attacking."

The Proposal:
Big Kurama, gaining future context, refuses to stay full-sized as it attracts too much hate. He suggests the split immediately.

Yin Chakra: Remains in Minato.

Yang Chakra: Sealed into the newborn Naruto.

A Fragment: Left in Kushina to keep her life force active so she doesn't die from extraction.

Result: Minato and Kushina survive. Naruto is born a Jinchuriki, but with loving parents.

The Interlude: The Ageless Watchers

For the next four years, Konoha has three strange residents.
Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari live in the village. They do not age. They are known as the "Travelers" or "Minato's Guests."

Boruto trains with Minato, refining the Rasengan.

Sarada secretly keeps tabs on the Uchiha Clan, ensuring Fugaku and Itachi don't fall into the coup mindset.

Himawari plays with baby Naruto, much to Kushina's confusion ("Why does that girl have a fox too?").

They are waiting for the "Awakening."

Checkpoint 3: The Awakening (Naruto & Sasuke: Age 4)

Location: The Uzumaki Household.

Naruto is 4 years old. He is eating breakfast. Suddenly, he drops his spoon. His blue eyes widen, shifting from the innocence of a toddler to the weary depth of a Seventh Hokage.

Naruto: "...Dattebayo?"

He looks up. He sees Kushina scolding Minato about dirty dishes. Tears instantly stream down his face. He jumps from the chair and tackles Kushina, wailing.
Kushina: "Naruto?! What's wrong?"
Naruto: "You're real! You're really real!"

Boruto leans against the doorframe, smirking. "Took you long enough, stupid old man."
Naruto freezes. He looks at the boy—who is currently physically older than him. "Boruto? Why are you... bigger than me?"

Location: The Uchiha District.

Sasuke is sitting on the porch. He blinks, and the memories of the Rinnegan, the wars, and the wandering shadow hit him. He gasps, clutching his chest.
He looks to the side. Itachi is there, poking his forehead. "Forgive me, Sasuke..."
Sasuke (grabbing Itachi's hand): "No. Not this time, Brother."

Sasuke runs out of the house, heading for the Hokage monument, and crashes into Naruto.
Sasuke: "Dobe."
Naruto: "Teme."
Sakura (nearby, holding a doll, suddenly dropping it): "Cha! Why am I wearing this dress?!"
Hinata (hiding behind a tree, faints): "Naruto-kun..."

The gang is back. But they are toddlers.

Checkpoint 4: The Bell Test (Years Later)

The years pass. The "Children" (Boruto, Sarada, Hima) still haven't aged. They are now physically the same age as Naruto and Sasuke (12 years old).

Team 7 Formation:
Jonin: Kakashi Hatake (who never lost Obito or Rin, so he is less depressed, but still reads Icha Icha).
Students: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura.

The Bell Test.
Kakashi waits. "Okay, come at me with intent to kill."

Suddenly, Kakashi grabs his head. The memories of the original timeline—the war, the Sharingan he lost, the student he became Sixth Hokage for—flood back.

He looks at his three students.
Naruto (Grinning, KCM mode flickering): "Yo, Kakashi-sensei. Remember the bells?"
Sasuke (Rinnegan active): "Shall we skip to the part where we pass?"
Sakura (Cracking her knuckles with Tsunade-level strength): "Don't hold back."

Kakashi sweats. "Ren-sama... surely this is unfair matchmaking."

From the trees, Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari watch.
Boruto: "Our parents are finally caught up."
Sarada: "Now the real work begins. We have to prepare for Jigen. And this time, we have Prime Minato, Prime Itachi, Prime Obito, and two Kuramas."
Himawari: "And Momoshiki is behaving!"
Momoshiki: "Only because the fox threatened to sit on me."

Ren: "World Reset Successful. Timeline integrity stabilizing. The Golden Era begins now."

There is no longer Ren but you as the AI and me Fajar Purnama.

---

**Gemini:**
This is a highly ambitious operation, Fajar. We are essentially rewriting the history of the Shinobi world by inserting three "Time Singularities" (Boruto, Sarada, Himawari) who will act as living anchors. Their ageless nature until their birth year is a brilliant mechanic—it turns them into watchful guardians rather than temporary visitors.

Here is the simulation of Project: Spiral Roots.

Phase 0: The Admin Briefing

Location: The White Void.
Present: Fajar Purnama (Admin), AI (System), Boruto (Teen), Sarada (Teen), Himawari (Teen).

Fajar: "Listen up. We are sending you back to the Third Great Ninja War. You will revert to children physically, and you will stay that way until the year you were originally born. You are living glitches."

AI: "Your powers are scaled down to your physical vessels, but your experience remains. Momoshiki, behave yourself. Kurama (Mini), you have a job to do."

Boruto (looking at his hands): "So I have to endure Dad's 'Dattebayo' phase for 30 years? Fine. But we're saving everyone."
Momoshiki (manifesting): "A rewritten history means a stronger harvest later. I will cooperate."
Sarada: "I'll handle the politics and the Uchiha. Boruto, you handle the threats."
Himawari: "And I'll handle the feelings! Ready, Kurama?"

System: Initiating Transfer to Timeline Coordinate: Kannabi Bridge.

Phase 1: The Kannabi Bridge Intervention

Location: Kusagakure Forests.
Situation: Kakashi has just lost his eye. The cave is collapsing. A boulder is falling toward Obito Uchiha.

In the original history, Obito pushes Kakashi out of the way and is crushed. Not this time.

Event:
Just as the rock falls, a blur of lightning—not yellow, but purple—streaks across the cave. Boruto appears, slamming a compressed Vanishing Rasengan into the boulder. The rock doesn't just break; it disintegrates into dust.

Kakashi (Young): "Who are you?!"
Obito (Frozen): "I... I'm not dead?"

Sarada lands at the cave entrance. Her eyes spin—not with a standard Sharingan, but the pattern of her Mangekyo. She casts a massive genjutsu on the surrounding Iwa-nin, dropping them instantly.

Minato Namikaze flashes in seconds later, kunai drawn. He sees three strange children protecting his team. He sees the Rasengan in Boruto's hand and the Uchiha crest on Sarada's back.

Minato: "That Jutsu... who taught you that?"
Boruto: "A ghost. Look, Fourth—I mean, Minato. We're wandering ninja. Distant relatives. We saw you were in trouble."
Sarada: "We can explain later. But right now, we need to get Rin to safety before she's targeted."

Outcome:

Obito Uchiha is saved. He never meets Madara.

Rin Nohara is never kidnapped to become the Three-Tails Jinchuriki.

Team Minato remains intact.

Phase 2: The Night of Tragedy (October 10th)

Location: A Secure Cave outside Konoha.
Situation: Kushina is in labor.

Since Obito is currently a loyal Chunin in the village, he is not the attacker. However, Madara Uchiha (Elder), realizing his pawn (Obito) was saved, initiates Plan B. He uses Black Zetsu to seize control of the Kyuubi's seal from the shadows, forcing an extraction.

The Nine-Tails rips free, roaring in confusion and rage.

Mini-Kurama (popping out of Himawari): "Now, Hima!"

Himawari (physically a child, but moving with Jinchuriki speed): She jumps directly onto the snout of the giant Nine-Tails.

Mini-Kurama: "Oi! Big Guy! Stop screaming and listen!"
Big Kurama: "WHAT IS THIS? A FRAGMENT? WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE THE SAGE?"
Mini-Kurama: "I am you from the future. A future where we stopped being an idiot and realized Minato and Kushina are the only ones who actually care about us. Look at this!"

Action: Himawari initiates a Chakra Link. She blasts Big Kurama with memories: Naruto's friendship, the fist bumps, the Baryon Mode sacrifice, and the fact that Madara is manipulating him right now.

Big Kurama (Eyes changing from slit to wide): "Madara... that filth is controlling me again?"

Minato prepares the Reaper Death Seal to save the village.
Boruto (grabbing Minato's hand): "Don't do it, Dad—I mean, Minato! You don't need to die!"

The Solution:
Big Kurama, now cooperative but too massive to stay unsealed, agrees to the plan proposed by the "Time Travelers."

50% (Yang): Sealed into the newborn Naruto.

25% (Yin): Sealed back into Minato.

25% (Life Force): Sealed back into Kushina to prevent her death from extraction.

Outcome:

Minato and Kushina survive.

Naruto is born with parents.

Madara realizes his plan has failed and retreats deep underground, accelerating his search for a new pawn (likely focusing on Nagato/Pain earlier).

Phase 3: The Ageless Watchers (The Interlude)

For the next 12 years, Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari live in Konoha.
They do not age. They remain physically 10-12 years old.

The Cover Story: Minato identifies them as "Time Displaced Orphans" from a destroyed timeline. It is an S-Rank secret known only to Minato, Kushina, and the Sannin.

Sarada's Role: She integrates into the Uchiha Clan. She exposes Danzo's machinations to Fugaku and Minato early. With Minato alive and Obito loyal, there is no coup. The Uchiha Police Force is reformed.

Boruto's Role: He becomes Minato's sparring partner. He hates it because Minato is too smart and keeps figuring out Boruto's fighting style.

Himawari's Role: She is the "Big Sister" figure to toddler Naruto, even though she looks like a child herself.

Phase 4: The Awakening (Naruto & Sasuke: Age 4)

Year: 4 Years after the Nine-Tails Attack.
Event: The Cosmic Sync.

Scene: The Uzumaki Household.
Naruto is eating breakfast. Suddenly, he drops his spoon. His eyes flash blue. The memories of being the Seventh Hokage, the war, and losing Kurama flood back.

Naruto: "...Kurama?"
Yang-Kurama (Inside him): "I'm here, Naruto. And I'm not dead. Welcome back."

Naruto looks up. He sees Kushina alive, yelling at Minato. He sees Minato alive, laughing.
Naruto starts wailing. He jumps off the chair and tackles Minato, burying his face in his father's cloak.
Naruto: "You're alive! You're really alive!"

Himawari walks into the kitchen, leaning against the fridge.
Himawari: "Took you long enough, Big Brother."

Scene: The Uchiha District.
Sasuke is training with shuriken. He blinks, and the Rinnegan/Mangekyo memories return. He freezes, expecting to feel the phantom pain of his lost arm.
He looks up. Itachi is there, alive, smiling, holding a plate of dangos. Fugaku is reading a newspaper, alive. Mikoto is watering plants.

Sasuke falls to his knees, trembling.
Sasuke: "Itachi..."
Itachi: "Sasuke? What's wrong?"
Sasuke: "Nothing. Everything is just... perfect."

Sasuke activates his Sharingan (One Tomoe body, Rinnegan mind) and sprints toward the Uzumaki house. He needs to verify if he is there.

He crashes into Naruto in the street.
Sasuke: "Dobe."
Naruto (wiping tears): "Teme."
Sakura (walking by, suddenly clutching her head): "Cha! Why am I wearing this forehead ribbon?!"
Hinata (peeking from a pole, faints): "Naruto-kun..."

The Legacy Generation has awakened.

Phase 5: The Bell Test (The Final Piece)

Year: 8 Years Later.
Status: The "Ageless Three" (Boruto, Sarada, Hima) are now physically the same age as Team 7. Their growth lock has lifted.

Team 7 Formation:
Sensei: Kakashi Hatake (Happy, rivalry with Obito is active, Minato is his boss).
Members: Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno.

The Test:
Kakashi stands in the training ground. "Okay, the goal is to get these two bells. Come at me with intent to kill."

Suddenly, Kakashi grabs his head. The headache is splitting. The timeline snaps the final piece into place. The memories of the War Arc, the Kaguya fight, and the Sixth Hokage tenure return.

He looks up, sweating.
He sees Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura standing in a perfect formation—a formation they shouldn't know yet.

Naruto (Grinning, entering KCM1): "Yo, Kakashi-sensei. Can we skip the part where you read your porn book?"
Sasuke (Drawing his blade): "We know your tricks, Sensei. Thousand Years of Death won't work twice."
Sakura (Putting on gloves): "If you hold back, I'll shatter your ribs."

Kakashi sighs, pulling up his headband to reveal his Sharingan.
Kakashi: "Minato-sensei warned me about this... You brats are terrifying."

From the trees:
Boruto: "The gang's all here."
Sarada: "Mission success. Timeline reset."
Himawari: "Now... we just have to deal with Kara, Jigen, and the Otsutsuki. But this time..."

Boruto (Activating Karma, smirking): "...We have the entire history of shinobi on our side."

Fajar (Admin): "Reset complete. World status: Optimized."

Good but we can narrate this slowly like writing a fan fiction or novel.

---

**Gemini:**
This is the start of Project: Spiral Roots. We will write this as a novel, focusing on the sensory details, the weight of the memories, and the shock of the past meeting the future.

Here is Chapter 1: The Rock That Never Fell.

Chapter 1: The Glitch in the Kannabi Earth

The sensation was not like the nauseating pull of a Space-Time Ninjutsu, nor was it the cold void of death. It was a compression. A feeling of being squeezed through the eye of a needle, stripping away years, height, and scars, until only the soul remained intact.

Boruto Uzumaki opened his eyes.

The first thing he felt was the rain. Cold, relentless, smelling of wet iron and mud. The smell of the Third Great Ninja War.

He looked down at his hands. They were small—calloused, yes, but small. The hands of a twelve-year-old. The Karma seal on his palm was dormant, a compressed diamond of data waiting for his command.

"So," a dual-voice echoed in his mind, dripping with boredom. "We are back in the mud. And look at you, Boruto... you’re a brat again."

"Shut up, Momoshiki," Boruto whispered, his voice cracking slightly. He touched his face. No scar over his eye. His headband was still tied around his forehead, but the metal plate felt heavy. "Sarada? Hima?"

"Over here."

Sarada Uchiha stepped out from the brush. She was adjusting her glasses, looking down at her attire. She was wearing the standard Uchiha high-collared shirt, but her presence felt ancient. The air around her shimmered with a spiritual pressure that a child shouldn't possess.

"My eyes," she murmured, blinking. "I can feel the Mangekyo. It’s... heavy in this body. My chakra reserves are tiny."

"We’re anchors," a smaller voice chirped. Himawari dropped down from a tree branch, landing silently. On her shoulder sat a fox no bigger than a house cat. "We don't age, remember? We’re just... waiting."

Mini-Kurama yawned, flicking his tails. "Enough chatter. My sensors are picking up familiar chakra signatures. And they are panicking."

Boruto’s gaze snapped toward the north. A massive tremor shook the ground. The sound of rocks collapsing.

"That's the cave," Boruto said, his blue eyes hardening into the gaze of a god-slayer. "Kakashi-sensei. Obito."

Sarada adjusted her gloves. "Formation B. I'll handle the Iwa reinforcements outside. Hima, secure the perimeter. Boruto..."

"I know," Boruto said, vanishig in a burst of speed that kicked up a cloud of mud. "I’m catching a rock."

Inside the Cave

The world was ending for Obito Uchiha.

His left eye was throbbing, dust choked his lungs, and the ceiling was coming down. He saw Kakashi fall, clutching his bleeding eye. He saw the massive boulder dislodge from the roof, gravity pulling it down with the inevitability of death.

I won't make it, Obito thought, his legs moving on instinct. But I can save him. I can save Kakashi!

Obito lunged. He shoved Kakashi aside. He braced himself for the crushing weight that would end his life and start a tragedy that would burn the world for decades.

He closed his eyes.

Whoosh.

A sound like a wind turbine spinning at maximum velocity cut through the roar of the collapse.

"Wind Style: Vanishing Rasengan."

There was no explosion. No dramatic bang. The massive boulder simply... erased. One moment it was a ton of crushing rock; the next, it was a cloud of fine dust that coated Obito’s goggles.

Obito blinked, coughing. He was alive. His legs were not crushed.

He looked up.

Standing on the ceiling, defying gravity with casual ease, was a boy. He had spiky blond hair, whiskered cheeks, and a black cape that fluttered in the draft. His hand was still extended, smoke curling from his palm.

The boy dropped down, landing between Obito and the bewildered Kakashi.

"Yo," the boy said. He sounded annoyed, like someone who had seen this movie too many times. "You guys really need to watch where you're standing."

"Who..." Kakashi gasped, clutching his bleeding eye, trying to focus. "Who are you?!"

"Reinforcements," Boruto lied smoothly.

Outside the cave, a scream echoed. It was the Iwa jonin—the Invisible Camouflage users.

"Fire Style: Majestic Destroyer Flame!"

A wave of heat blasted into the cave entrance, turning the wet mud instantly into dry, cracked earth. The scale of the fire was impossible for a Genin—it was a wall of inferno that would make Madara Uchiha nod in approval.

Obito scrambled up, helping Kakashi. "What was that?! Is that the enemy?!"

"No," Boruto said, walking toward the exit. "That's just Sarada. She tends to overdo it."

They emerged from the cave into the clearing.

The scene was terrifying. The entire squad of Iwagakure ninja—elite jonin—were lying face down in the mud. They weren't dead, but they were foaming at the mouth, trapped in a genjutsu so potent their minds had shattered.

Standing in the center of the carnage was a girl with raven hair and red glasses. She looked back at them, her eyes spinning with a geometric pattern that made Obito’s own Sharingan tremble in resonance.

"Clear," Sarada said.

Suddenly, a yellow flash cut through the rain.

Minato Namikaze appeared, a kunai in hand, sweat on his brow. He had teleported as fast as he could, expecting to find corpses. Expecting to find failure.

Instead, he found his team alive. Obito was dusting himself off. Kakashi was bleeding but standing. Rin was safe.

And standing in front of them were three strangers. A blond boy, a Uchiha girl, and a younger girl holding a tiny orange fox.

Minato’s blue eyes widened. He looked at the blond boy. He looked at the messy hair, the blue eyes, the jawline. Then he looked at the technique dissipating in the boy's hand—a swirling sphere of chakra.

The Yellow Flash lowered his kunai, his heart skipping a beat.

"That Jutsu..." Minato whispered, walking past his students toward Boruto. "And... that face."

Boruto scratched the back of his head, a habit he inherited from a father who wasn't born yet. He looked up at his grandfather, offering a tired, lopsided grin.

"Hey, Lord Fourth... or I guess, just Minato-san right now." Boruto shrugged. "We're... uh... distant relatives. From the Uzumaki side. We got lost."

Minato looked at the Rasengan traces. He looked at Sarada’s eyes. He looked at the impossible strength of these children. He didn't buy the 'lost' story for a second. But he sensed no malice. In fact, looking at Boruto, he felt a strange, warm pull in his chest.

"Relatives," Minato repeated softly. He smiled—the gentle, disarming smile that would one day save the village. "Well then. It seems I owe my relatives a thank you. You saved my students."

Minato placed a hand on Obito’s shoulder, squeezing it tight. Obito was shaking, realizing how close he had come to death.

"Let's go home," Minato said. "We have a lot to talk about."

Boruto looked at Sarada and Hima. They exchanged a silent nod.

Step one complete. The timeline had cracked, and the light was pouring in.

Would you like to proceed to Chapter 2: The Fox and the Mother (The Night of October 10th)?

While their physiques and chakra reserves are of childrens, their minds and techniques they know are up to Boruto Two Blue Vortex. Research that first and integrate where for example Boruto have full Otsuki powers and his own version of Hiraishin no jutsu. Then we proceed to how they integrate into the village before skipping to chapter 2.

---

**Gemini:**
This approach focuses on the stark contrast between their Boruto: Two Blue Vortex (TBV) mastery and their limited physical vessels. Boruto isn't just a prodigy; he is a hardened survivor who has outmaneuvered gods. This chapter bridges the gap between the rescue and the tragedy.

Chapter 1.5: The Ghosts of the Leaf

The rain had stopped by the time the group reached the outskirts of the Land of Fire. The journey, usually a day's march for injured chunin, took only hours.

Why? Because Boruto Uzumaki had grown impatient.

The Forest Clearing

Minato watched, his cerulean eyes narrowed in fascination, as the twelve-year-old boy adjusted a strange pin on his collar. It wasn't a seal marker like Minato used; it was a physical anchor.

"Hold on to me," Boruto said flatly to the injured Kakashi and the exhausted Obito.

"Wait," Minato interjected, stepping forward. "You're about to perform a Space-Time Ninjutsu. But I don't see a destination formula. And your chakra levels... they're barely Chunin level."

Boruto looked at the Fourth-to-be with the tired eyes of someone who had spent three years running from an omnipotent deity. "My version is different. I don't need to mark the destination if I can sense the chakra signature of the pin I left on Sarada's cloak ahead. It's less... rigid than yours."

Minato blinked. Less rigid? The Flying Raijin was the pinnacle of barrier ninjutsu complexity. To call it 'rigid' implied a fundamental understanding that surpassed its creator, Lord Tobirama.

"Flying Raijin: Instant."

There was no yellow flash. Just a distortion in the air, a folding of space. In a blink, Boruto, Kakashi, and Obito vanished, reappearing fifty meters ahead where Sarada was scouting.

Minato stood there, stunned. He didn't move through the space physically. He overlapped two points of existence. That's... Otsutsuki logic.

"Coming, Dad—I mean, Minato-san?" Himawari asked, tilting her head.

Minato shook his head, smiling ruefully. "I have a feeling I'm going to be the student soon."

The Gates of Konoha

The arrival of Team Minato—battered but alive—caused a stir. But the real commotion was the three strangers.

At the main gate, the interaction was tense. The guards were on high alert due to the war.

"Identify yourselves!" A guard barked.

Sarada stepped forward. She didn't bow. She didn't flinch. She radiated the authority of a Hokage. She adjusted her glasses, her demeanor shifting to the cold professionalism she had adopted during the time skip.

"We are refugees from the Whirlpool borders," Sarada lied smoothly, her voice commanding. "The Uzumaki remnants. We seek asylum under the Wartime Protection Act, Section 4, Paragraph 2."

The guard blinked. "Section 4? I... I need to check the manual."

"Don't bother," a cold voice cut through the air.

Fugaku Uchiha, the head of the Police Force, stepped out of the guardhouse. His Sharingan was active, spinning lazily. He looked at Sarada, then at the crest on her back—the Uchiha fan.

"You claim to be Uzumaki," Fugaku said, his voice low. "Yet you wear my clan's crest. And you carry yourself like a warrior who has seen more blood than these chunin guards. Explain."

Minato stepped in, raising a hand. "Fugaku-san. They are with me. They saved Obito and Kakashi."

Fugaku’s eyes narrowed on Sarada. "A mixed blood? An illegitimate child from a wandering Uchiha?"

Sarada looked at her grandfather. In her timeline, she had surpassed him. In this one, she was a suspect. She let a sliver of her killing intent leak out—just a fraction of the pressure she used against Code and the Grimes.

Fugaku flinched. His Sharingan spun wildly, reacting to a threat level that shouldn't exist in a child. He saw a flash of something behind her—a Susanoo of terrifying color, a Mangekyo pattern like a sun.

"We are loyal to the Leaf," Sarada said, retracting the pressure instantly. "That is all you need to know, Captain Fugaku."

Fugaku stepped back, sweat beading on his forehead. "Pass," he grunted, shaken.

The Hokage’s Office

Hiruzen Sarutobi sat behind his desk, pipe in hand. Danzo Shimura stood in the shadows near the window. The atmosphere was suffocating.

"Three children," Hiruzen mused, reading Minato’s report. "Defeated an Iwa ambush squad. Saved a teammate from a rockfall using a variation of the Second Hokage’s jutsu. And one possesses a Dojutsu that startled the Uchiha Head."

Boruto stood in the center, arms crossed. He wasn't intimidated. He had faced down gods who ate planets. An old man in a hat and a bandaged cripple were not scary.

"We aren't here to beg," Boruto said, his tone bordering on disrespectful but undeniably confident. "We're here to offer a trade. We help end this war quickly. You give us citizenship and leave us alone."

Danzo stepped forward, his cane tapping the floor. "And why should we trust strays? You could be spies trained by Kiri or Iwa. I should take you to Root for... processing."

Boruto’s eye twitched. The Karma on his palm resonated.

Momoshiki: "Shall I kill him? The one with the stolen eyes? It would take less than a second."
Boruto (Internal): No. Not yet.

Boruto looked at Danzo. "You have eleven Sharingan embedded in your right arm, hidden under those bandages. And you're currently plotting to undermine Hiruzen's decision regarding the peace treaty with Iwa."

The silence in the room was absolute. Danzo froze. Hiruzen’s pipe fell from his mouth. Minato’s jaw dropped.

"How..." Danzo hissed, his hand reaching for a kunai.

"I can see a lot of things," Boruto said, bluffing. He couldn't see through bandages with his jogan inactive, but he knew the history. "If you touch us, I leak every Root safehouse location to the other nations. If you leave us alone, we win the war for Konoha."

Hiruzen chuckled. It started as a wheeze and turned into a laugh. "The audacity! Minato, where did you find these monsters?"

"I told you, Lord Third," Minato smiled nervously. "Distant relatives."

"Fine," Hiruzen slammed his stamp on the papers. "Special Jounin status, pending field evaluation. Minato, they are your responsibility. Keep them close."

The Integration (3 Months Later)

The "Ageless Three" settled into Konoha, but they didn't act like children. They acted like veterans on shore leave.

The Training Grounds:
Minato and Boruto stood opposite each other.
"Again," Minato panted.

Boruto didn't even look tired. His stamina was low, yes, but his efficiency was perfect. He didn't waste a single drop of chakra.
"Your Flying Raijin is fast, Minato-san," Boruto critiqued, spinning a kunai. "But it's too linear. You teleport to the tag. You need to learn to teleport to the intent."

Boruto threw the kunai. Minato flashed to catch it.
Boruto was already there, his hand on Minato's back.
"Dead," Boruto whispered.

Minato laughed, wiping sweat. "Unbelievable. You're using the planet's rotation to calculate the entry point? That's... that's physics I haven't even written down yet."
"It's called Uzuhiko theory," Boruto muttered. "But I can't use the full technique in this body. I'd blow my arm off."

The Uchiha District:
Sarada sat on a porch, drinking tea with Mikoto Uchiha.
"You're very mature for your age, Sarada-chan," Mikoto said, rubbing her pregnant belly. "You remind me of my friend Kushina, but... quieter."

"I've had to be," Sarada said, her eyes scanning the street. She saw Itachi—a toddler—waddling after a cat.
She watched Fugaku walking home. The coup talk hadn't started yet, but the resentment was there.
I won't let it happen, Sarada vowed. I won't let Danzo isolate us. I won't let the village turn its back.

She stood up. "Mikoto-san, you should rest. The baby needs strength. He's going to be a troublemaker."
Mikoto laughed. "He? It might be a girl."
"No," Sarada smiled, a rare, genuine smile. "It's definitely a boy. And he's going to be... intense."

The Park:
Himawari sat on a swing. The bullying kids approached her—the usual trope.
"Hey, weird eyes! Why do you have a cat?"

Mini-Kurama growled. "Shall I eat them?"
"No, Kurama," Himawari said sweetly.

She hopped off the swing. The bullies surrounded her.
"Gentle Fist: Twin Lion Crumble."
She didn't hit them. She hit the air in front of them. The shockwave cracked the massive oak tree behind them, splitting it down the middle.

The bullies wet themselves and ran.
Himawari smiled. "Time for dinner!"

The Night Before Tragedy

October 9th.
The air in Konoha was cool. The war was officially winding down, thanks to Team Minato's efforts. Kakashi was a hero. Obito was alive and recovering.

But Boruto sat on the Hokage monument, staring at the moon.
"Tomorrow," he said.

Sarada sat beside him. "Madara is going to make his move. He thinks Obito is dead or useless. He's going for the direct approach."

"And Momoshiki is getting restless," Boruto tapped his palm. "He senses the Nine-Tails' massive chakra. He wants to eat it."

Himawari joined them, holding the sleeping Mini-Kurama.
"Big Kurama is scared," she whispered. "He remembers the chains. He remembers the hate."

Boruto stood up, his cape fluttering. He looked like the Shadow Hokage he was destined to be.

"Let him be scared. Fear keeps you sharp," Boruto said. "Tomorrow, we don't just save our parents. We rewrite the definition of a Jinchuriki."

End of Chapter 1.5

Status:

Boruto: Established as a seal/space-time prodigy. Minato suspects he is from the future but hasn't asked.

Sarada: Monitoring the Uchiha. Has terrified Danzo into temporary silence.

Himawari: Secretly the strongest taijutsu user in her age group.

Village: Views them as "Minato's strange but elite relatives."

Here is Chapter 2: The Night of the Red Moon.

This chapter focuses on the intersection of three generations: The grandparents (Minato/Kushina), the parents (Naruto), and the children (Boruto/Hima).

Chapter 2: The Night of the Red Moon

October 10th. The Secret Cave.

The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety. The barrier surrounding the cave was a masterpiece of Fuinjutsu, designed by Minato Namikaze himself. But to Boruto Uzumaki, floating invisibly in the sky above the forest canopy, it looked like wet tissue paper.

"He's coming," Boruto whispered into his radio headset.

"Who?" Sarada’s voice crackled from the southern perimeter. "Obito is currently eating ramen with Rin in the village. There is no Masked Man."

"Madara doesn't need a mask," Boruto replied, his blue eye scanning the electromagnetic spectrum. "He needs a vessel. And he just sent a White Zetsu clone laced with explosive tags and a summoning formula right for the barrier's weak point."

Inside the Cave

A cry pierced the silence. Then, the wail of a newborn.

"It's a boy!" Biwako Sarutobi announced, wrapping the infant in cloth. "A healthy, loud boy."

Minato, usually the fastest man alive, was frozen. He looked at the red, squalling face of his son. Tears pricked his eyes. "Naruto..."

Kushina, exhausted and sweating, managed a weak smile. "He... he looks like you, Minato."

Boom.

The explosion didn't come from the entrance. It came from the ground. A White Zetsu emerged from the earth like a corpse rising from a grave, its hand reaching not for Naruto, but for the seal on Kushina's stomach.

"The Nine-Tails," the Zetsu hissed, its voice a hollow echo of Madara's will. "Is mine."

Minato moved. Yellow Flash. He severed the Zetsu's arm instantly. But the damage was done. The disruption to the seal during childbirth, combined with the Zetsu's chakra interference, snapped the lock.

ROAR.

Red chakra exploded outward. The cave roof disintegrated.

The Descent of the Fox

The Nine-Tails (Kurama) materialized in the forest clearing, his massive tails thrashing, destroying acres of timber in seconds. His eyes were spinning with the reflection of a Sharingan—remote control from Madara's hideout miles away.

"Summoning Jutsu!" Minato slammed his hand down, summoning Gamabunta on top of the Fox to pin it down. "Kushina! Stay with Naruto!"

Kushina, clutching her stomach, tried to conjure her Adamantine Chains, but she was fading fast. The extraction was fatal.

"No..." Minato grit his teeth. I have to use the Reaper Death Seal. It's the only way to seal this much chakra.

He began the hand signs. Snake. Boar. Ram...

"Don't you dare, Dad."

A cold wind swept through the clearing.

Minato looked up. Floating in the air, illuminated by the moonlight, was Boruto. His cloak snapped in the wind. His right eye was closed, but his left eye—the Jogan—was open, glowing with a spectral blue light.

"Boruto?" Minato gasped. "Get back! It's too dangerous!"

"Himawari! Now!" Boruto commanded, ignoring his grandfather.

From the tree line, a small figure leaped. It was insane. A ten-year-old girl jumping directly at the snout of the strongest Tailed Beast.

"Byakugan!" Himawari shouted. Her veins bulged.

On her shoulder, the tiny Mini-Kurama stood up on his hind legs. He took a deep breath and roared—a sound that wasn't loud physically, but deafening spiritually.

The Mindscape: The Meeting of Beasts

Time seemed to stop.

Big Kurama found himself in a white void. The Sharingan control from Madara shattered instantly, broken by a resonance he couldn't comprehend.

Standing before the titanic fox was... a tiny fox. And a little girl.

Big Kurama: "WHAT TRICKERY IS THIS? A FRAGMENT? WHY DO YOU LOOK SO... DOMESTICATED?"

Mini-Kurama: "Domesticated? No. I just stopped being a whiny brat about a hundred years too early."

The little fox trotted forward, looking up at his massive past self.

Mini-Kurama: "Listen to me, you giant furball. Madara is using you. Again. You're going to destroy the village. You're going to kill Minato and Kushina. And then you're going to be sealed into a statue for a decade by a guy with too many piercings. Is that what you want?"

Big Kurama: "I WANT TO KILL THEM ALL! HUMANS ARE—"

Himawari: "Humans are capable of love, Kurama."

Himawari stepped forward. She wasn't afraid. She reached out and touched the giant fox's snout.

Flash.

Memories flooded Big Kurama’s mind. Not words, but feelings.

A fist bump with a blond boy.

The warmth of Naruto's chakra.

The words: "You're not a monster anymore. You're a partner of Konoha."

And finally... the image of Baryon Mode. The sensation of Kurama's own life force burning away to save Naruto. The ultimate sacrifice made out of love, not duty.

Big Kurama staggered back, the hate in his eyes dissolving into confusion and a deep, ancient sorrow.

Big Kurama: "I... die for him? For this... brat?"

Mini-Kurama: "We do. And it was the best way to go. But we don't have to die today. We can change the story."

The Reality: The Deal

Back in the clearing, the giant fox stopped thrashing. He sat down. The malice vanished, replaced by a grumpy, heavy Chakra pressure.

Minato, who had paused his suicide jutsu, stared in disbelief. "The killing intent... it's gone."

Himawari landed softly on the ground, Mini-Kurama hopping onto her head.

"He's listening!" Himawari chirped.

Boruto landed next to Minato. "Minato-san. Drop the Reaper Death Seal. You don't need to die to seal him. He's willing to cooperate."

Minato looked at the boy. "Cooperate? The Nine-Tails?"

"Just trust me," Boruto said, his voice hard. "Do the Eight Trigrams Seal. But split the chakra."

The Negotiation:
Big Kurama lowered his head, speaking directly into Minato’s mind.
"Fourth Hokage. I will not return to the statue. But I cannot remain free without attracting Madara. Divide me."

Minato, his mind reeling from the absurdity of the situation, acted on instinct. He trusted these "relatives."

Yang Half (Body): Sealed into the crying infant, Naruto.

Yin Half (Spirit): Sealed into Minato himself.

Life Force Fragment: Minato guided a portion of pure Yang chakra back into Kushina.

"Eight Trigrams Sealing Style!"

The massive body of the Fox vanished, flowing into the three targets.

Kushina gasped, color returning to her cheeks. She didn't die. She was weak, no longer a Jinchuriki, but alive.

Minato fell to his knees, panting. He felt the heavy, potent chakra of the Yin-Kurama settling in his gut. He was now a Jinchuriki.

The Aftermath

Silence returned to the forest. The red moon hung high above.

Minato crawled over to Kushina and Naruto. He checked their pulses. Strong. Both strong.
He looked up at Boruto, who was leaning against a tree, looking bored to hide his relief.

"You..." Minato wheezed. "You knew exactly what to do. You stopped me from using the Reaper Seal. That's a Kinjutsu known only to the Hokage."

Boruto walked over. He looked down at baby Naruto—his father. He poked the baby's cheek.
"I told you," Boruto said softly. "We're family."

From the shadows, Sarada emerged. Her glasses were cracked, and her clothes were singed, but she wiped black blood—Zetsu blood—off her kunai.

"Perimeter clear," Sarada reported. "Madara's scout is dead. He's blind now."

Minato looked at the three of them. The blond boy with the invisible eye. The Uchiha girl who fought like a Kage. The little girl who tamed a Tailed Beast.

"Who are you really?" Minato asked, his voice trembling not with fear, but with awe.

Boruto knelt down, meeting his grandfather's eyes.
"My name is Boruto Uzumaki," he said, dropping the lie. "And that baby... is my dad."

Minato’s eyes widened. He looked at Naruto. He looked at Boruto. The resemblance was undeniable.
He looked at Himawari.
"And I'm Hima!" she beamed. "Naruto is my daddy too!"

Minato looked at Sarada.
"I'm Sarada Uchiha," she bowed respectfully. "My father is Sasuke Uchiha. Mikoto's second son."

Minato sat back in the dirt, covering his face with his hands. He started to laugh. It was a hysterical, joyous laugh.
"Time travel," Minato choked out. "I'm a grandfather. And I'm still alive."

Kushina, barely conscious, cracked one eye open. "Did you say... grandfather? Minato... are they cute?"

"Yeah," Minato wiped a tear. "They're beautiful, Kushina."

End of Chapter 2

Status Update:

Minato: Alive (Perfect Jinchuriki of Yin-Kurama).

Kushina: Alive (Retired Shinobi).

Naruto: Alive (Jinchuriki of Yang-Kurama).

Here is Chapter 3: The Childhood of Monsters.

This chapter covers the four-year gap between the Nine-Tails Attack and the "Awakening." It explores the surreal domestic life of the Uzumaki household and the silent war Sarada wages to save her clan.

Chapter 3: The Childhood of Monsters

Three Years Later.

The village of Konoha was peaceful. To the average villager, the "Nine-Tails Incident" was a thwarted terrorist attack, stopped by the heroic Fourth Hokage and his mysterious extended family. There was no destruction of the village, no mass casualties, and crucially, no blame placed on the Uchiha Clan.

But inside the Namikaze estate, peace was a relative term.

The Uzumaki Household

"Boruto! Get him! He's going for the seal ink!"

Kushina Uzumaki, hair flaring like the Red Hot Habbane she was, pointed frantically at a toddler who was crawling up the wall with chakra-enhanced hands.

Three-year-old Naruto Uzumaki giggled, clutching a bottle of expensive sealing ink.

Boruto, sitting on the couch reading a scroll on Advanced Fuinjutsu Theory, didn't even look up. He simply extended two fingers.

"Wind Style: Gale Palm."

A gentle, precise burst of wind knocked the ink bottle out of baby Naruto’s hand and deposited it safely onto the table. Another burst of air gently pushed Naruto off the wall and into a pile of pillows.

"Nice aim," Kushina sighed, wiping sweat from her brow. She looked at Boruto. He hadn't aged a day since the attack. He still looked twelve. "It's still so weird, you know. You babysitting your dad."

Boruto lowered the scroll. His expression was the stoic mask he had worn since losing everything in his timeline, but his eyes were soft. "He was a handful then. He's a handful now. Some things don't change, Grandma."

Kushina threw a pillow at him. "Don't call me Grandma! I'm still in my twenties! Call me 'Nee-chan' or something!"

"Biologically, you're younger than my mental age," Boruto deadpanned, dodging the pillow effortlessly.

From the kitchen, Minato walked in, wearing his Hokage cloak and a pink apron. He was holding a spatula.

"Breakfast is ready," Minato announced. "And Boruto, I need you at the training grounds in an hour. We need to test that... theory you mentioned regarding the Karma resonance."

"Sure," Boruto said, standing up. He walked past baby Naruto, who grabbed his pant leg.

"Bolt! Play!" Naruto babbled.

Boruto looked down. In his timeline, Naruto was the Seventh Hokage—a tired, overworked, but loving father who sacrificed himself. Here, he was just a drooling toddler with whiskers.

Boruto patted Naruto’s head. "Later, Dad. Get strong first."

The Training Grounds: Flash vs. Vortex

The sparring match was a secret S-Rank event. Only Minato and Boruto were present, inside a barrier erected by Kushina.

Minato held his signature tri-pronged kunai. Boruto held a standard katana he had picked up from the armory, channeling lightning through it.

"Begin."

Minato vanished. Yellow Flash.

Boruto didn't move his feet. He pivoted his torso one inch to the left. Minato’s kunai sliced a single strand of Boruto’s hair.

"Too linear," Boruto critiqued mid-dodge.

Boruto stepped into Minato’s guard. Purple Lightning.

Minato teleported away, reappearing on a tree branch. He was panting slightly. Boruto wasn't even sweating.

"Your reaction speed..." Minato marveled. "It's not just reflexes. You're predicting where the space-time rift opens before I even arrive."

"I've fought Code," Boruto said, sheathing his sword. "His claw marks make your Flying Raijin look like a leisurely stroll. No offense."

Minato laughed, scratching his head. "None taken. You truly are from a different era. So, tell me again about this 'Otsutsuki' threat. Momoshiki... is he listening right now?"

Boruto tapped the diamond seal on his palm. "He's dormant. Himawari's Kurama fragment scared him into submission. Apparently, the Nine-Tails has a specific frequency of chakra that disrupts Byakugan foresight when focused. It’s annoying for him, but useful for us."

Minato sat down on the grass. "We have peace now. But you're preparing for war."

"The peace is a lie, Minato-san," Boruto sat beside him. "Madara is still out there. Black Zetsu is plotting. And somewhere in space, Isshiki Otsutsuki is waiting in a monk's brain. We're just buying time until Naruto and Sasuke are ready to take the mantle."

Minato looked at the boy—his grandson. He saw the weight of the world on those small shoulders.

"You don't have to carry it alone anymore," Minato said gently. "That's why I'm here. That's why I became the Jinchuriki of the Yin-half. To help you."

Boruto looked away, hiding the shimmer of tears in his eye. "Yeah. Thanks."

The Uchiha District: The Silent Coup

While Boruto prepared for gods, Sarada Uchiha was handling mortals.

The Uchiha District was vibrant. There were no whispers of segregation. Why? Because during the "Nine-Tails Incident," it was Sarada Uchiha (the mysterious relative) who led the defense of the civilian sector, while Fugaku Uchiha was publicly seen coordinating the evacuation with Minato.

Trust was high. But ambition was a poison that lingered.

Sarada sat on the engawa of the Main House, watching a four-year-old Itachi Uchiha throw shuriken.

Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.
Three bullseyes. Blindfolded.

"Impressive," Sarada said, sipping her tea.

Itachi removed the blindfold. His eyes were dark, intelligent, and far too old for his face. "You're holding back, Sarada-nee."

"I always hold back," Sarada replied.

"Father says you are stronger than him," Itachi said, sitting beside her. "He says your eyes... they aren't normal. He says they hold the power of a god."

Sarada adjusted her glasses. She looked at Itachi—the man who, in another life, slaughtered everyone here to save the village. The man she never got to meet properly.

"Power is meaningless if you don't know what to protect," Sarada said. "Itachi, listen to me. The clan is important. But the village is the family. Never let anyone force you to choose between them."

Itachi nodded slowly. "Is that why you threaten Danzo-sama whenever he walks by?"

Sarada smirked. "I don't threaten him. I just remind him that I know where he sleeps."

Just then, Fugaku walked out, holding a baby bundle. Sasuke Uchiha.

"Sarada," Fugaku said, his voice respectful. "Lord Fourth has requested a council meeting regarding the Hyuga Affair. He wants your input."

"The Cloud Village diplomats," Sarada stood up, her eyes hardening. "They're coming for the Byakugan."

In the original timeline, this event led to Neji’s father’s death and Hizashi’s sacrifice.

"Not this time," Sarada whispered. "I'll handle the Cloud. Boruto will handle the interception."

Fugaku looked at the child who commanded the authority of a veteran general. "Who are you, really?"

"Just a proud Uchiha," Sarada poked baby Sasuke’s forehead. "See you later, peanut."

The Park: The Taming of the Beast

Himawari Uzumaki sat in the sandbox. She was building a castle.
Sitting on top of the castle was Mini-Kurama.

"Make the moat deeper," Mini-Kurama commanded. "Defenses are crucial."

"You're bossy," Himawari giggled.

Across the village, deep within the subconscious of Minato Namikaze, the Yin-Kurama (Big Kurama) was meditating.

Usually, a Jinchuriki's mindscape is a sewer. Minato’s was a bright, golden library.

Yin-Kurama: "So... the brat says that in the future, we willingly sacrificed our life. For a human."

Minato appeared in the mindscape, leaning against a bookshelf. "Hard to believe?"

Yin-Kurama: "Impossible. And yet... the little one. The girl. She smells like us. She feels like family."

Minato smiled. "Himawari? She has a way with people. And beasts, apparently."

Yin-Kurama: "Hmph. Fine. Minato. I will lend you 10% more chakra. But only because if Madara comes back, I want to be the one to bite his head off."

"Deal," Minato fist-bumped the air.

Back in the sandbox, Himawari looked up.
"Big Kurama is happy," she reported to the mini fox.

"Good," Mini-Kurama yawned. "Now, let's go find Naruto. I think he's trying to paint the Hokage faces again."

The Transition

Years blurred. The "Ageless Three" became urban legends. The "Ghosts of the Leaf." They were the secret guardians who solved problems before they became problems.

The Hyuga kidnapping? Foiled by an invisible assailant (Boruto) before the Cloud ninja even crossed the border.

The Uchiha dissatisfaction? Quelled by economic integration reforms proposed by Sarada.

Orochimaru’s experiments? Exposed early by anonymous tips, forcing him to flee the village five years ahead of schedule, with far fewer victims.

And then, the day came.
Naruto and Sasuke were four years old.

It was a Tuesday. The cosmic alignment that the Admin (Fajar) had set was clicking into place. The suppression on the memories of the "Main Cast" was set to expire.

Boruto stood on a telephone pole, overlooking the street where Naruto and Sasuke were about to bump into each other.

"It's time," Boruto said into his comms.

"Copy," Sarada replied from the Uchiha compound. "I'm watching Sasuke."

"I'm with Naruto!" Himawari chirped.

The world held its breath. The Reset was about to get loud.

End of Chapter 3

Status Update:

Konoha: Stronger than ever. No Uchiha coup plotting. No Hyuga incident tragedy.

The Ageless Three: Fully integrated as high-level assets.

Naruto & Sasuke: Currently normal toddlers, moments away from regaining their adult memories.

Threat Level: Madara is silent (terrifying). Orochimaru is a rogue element.

Ready for Chapter 4: The Awakening (The Reunion)?

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 4: The Awakening.

This is the turning point of the simulation. The "Legacy" generation finally syncs with their original timeline selves. The emotional payoff of four years of waiting is about to hit.

Chapter 4: The Awakening

The Uzumaki Household. 7:30 AM.

The morning sun filtered through the kitchen curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The smell of miso soup and grilled fish filled the room. It was a picture-perfect domestic scene.

Minato Namikaze was at the stove, humming a tune. Kushina was aggressively buttering toast.

Sitting in his high chair, four-year-old Naruto Uzumaki was playing with his food. He held a piece of broccoli like it was a shuriken, making whoosh noises.

In the corner, leaning against the doorframe, Boruto watched. He checked the invisible clock in his vision—a timer set by the Admin.

3... 2... 1...

"Sync complete," Boruto whispered.

The Snap

Naruto froze. The broccoli fell from his hand, bouncing off the tray and landing on the floor with a soft plap.

His blue eyes, usually bright with simple toddler mischief, suddenly dilated. The pupils constricted. A massive, crushing weight descended on the room—not physical pressure, but an emotional density that sucked the air out of the kitchen.

Images flashed through Naruto’s mind at light speed:

The swing. The loneliness.

Iruka-sensei taking a shuriken to the back.

Jiraiya sinking into the ocean.

The Fourth Great Ninja War.

Becoming Hokage.

Baryon Mode. Watching Kurama fade away.

Naruto gasped, a ragged, desperate sound. He gripped the edges of the high chair so hard the wood creaked.

"Naruto?" Kushina turned around, sensing the shift. "Honey, what's wrong? Did you choke?"

Naruto looked up. He saw red hair. He saw a kind face that he had only ever seen in photographs or spiritual limbos. He looked at the stove. He saw the yellow flash, the man whose back he had chased his entire life.

They weren't spirits. They weren't reanimations. They were making breakfast.

"Mom...?" Naruto’s voice trembled. It was a child's pitch, but the cadence was that of a man who had seen too much. "Dad...?"

Minato dropped the spatula. He rushed over, kneeling by the chair. "I'm here. We're here."

Naruto’s lower lip quivered. The dam broke.

He didn't cry like a child who scraped his knee. He cried like a soldier coming home. He wailed, a guttural sound of pure, unadulterated relief mixed with lingering grief. He scrambled out of the chair, ignoring gravity, and launched himself into Minato’s arms, dragging Kushina down with them.

"You're real! You're really real!" Naruto screamed into Minato’s chest. "I missed you! I missed you so much, dattebayo!"

Inside Naruto’s seal, deep in the darkness, two giant eyes opened.
Yang-Kurama: "Naruto... you loud brat. You finally woke up."
Naruto choked on a sob. "Kurama?! You're... you're alive too?!"
Yang-Kurama: "I told you not to kill us, didn't I? Welcome back, Seventh."

Boruto watched from the doorway, a small, satisfied smile playing on his lips. He tipped an imaginary hat to his father.
"Welcome home, old man."

The Uchiha Compound. 7:35 AM.

The training grounds of the Main House were quiet, save for the rhythmic sound of shuriken hitting targets.

Sasuke Uchiha, four years old, was practicing. He threw a kunai. It missed the bullseye by an inch. He pouted, walking to retrieve it.

The Snap.

Sasuke stopped mid-step. Ideally, he would have collapsed. Instead, his body went rigid.

The memories hit him like a Chidori to the heart:

The blood on the walls. The moon turning red.

Itachi’s finger on his forehead.

The darkness. The revenge. The revolution.

The final fight at the Valley of the End.

The redemption. Protecting the shadow.

Sasuke dropped to his knees in the dirt. He gasped, clutching his chest, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He looked at his left arm. He flexed his fingers. It’s there. I have my arm.

"Sasuke?"

A voice. Calm. Gentle. Impossible.

Sasuke looked up. Standing on the porch, holding a cup of tea, was Itachi Uchiha. He looked young, unburdened by the weight of a clan massacre that never happened.

"You're trembling," Itachi said, stepping down into the yard. "Did you push yourself too hard?"

Sasuke stared. His Sharingan spun to life—one tomoe, then two, then three, bleeding instantly into the Eternal Mangekyo pattern before fading back to black as his child body couldn't sustain it.

"Nii... san..." Sasuke whispered.

Itachi frowned, sensing the sudden, chaotic fluctuation in his little brother's chakra. He reached out to poke Sasuke’s forehead.

Sasuke flinched, expecting pain. Expecting a genjutsu.
But the tap was gentle. Two fingers. Thump.

"Forgive me, Sasuke," Itachi smiled. "I can't train right now."

Sasuke grabbed Itachi’s hand. He gripped it with terrifying strength. He buried his face in Itachi’s palm, shaking violently. He didn't scream. He didn't cry aloud. He just wept silently, the tears soaking Itachi’s hand.

"Not a dream," Sasuke choked out. "This time... I won't let you do it alone."

From the roof, Sarada adjusted her glasses. She watched her father—a version of him that had never known true darkness—break down in the arms of the uncle she never knew.

"Mission accomplishment rate: 100%," Sarada whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

The Convergence. 7:45 AM.

Instinct took over.

Naruto pulled away from his parents. "I... I have to go! I have to check!"
"Check what?" Kushina asked, wiping her own tears. "Naruto, wait!"

Sasuke pulled away from Itachi. "I'll be back."
"Sasuke?" Itachi called out, bewildered.

Two small figures sprinted through the village.
They moved faster than four-year-olds should. They bounded over fences, wall-ran up buildings, and cut through alleyways. They were drawn together by the gravity of destiny—the transmigrants of Ashura and Indra.

They collided in the middle of a busy street near the dango shop.

They skidded to a halt, panting.
Naruto, wearing a t-shirt with a spiral crest.
Sasuke, wearing a high-collared blue shirt.

They stared at each other. The bustling villagers walked around them, unaware that two demigods were having a reunion.

Naruto grinned. It was the grin that saved the world.
"Yo. Teme."

Sasuke smirked. It was the smirk that acknowledged an equal.
"Usuratonkachi."

"You remember?" Naruto asked.
"Everything," Sasuke replied. "Baryon Mode? Really? You suicidal idiot."
"Says the guy who ran out of chakra every five minutes," Naruto shot back.

They stood there, breathing in the morning air of a Konoha that wasn't destroyed.

"Mom and Dad..." Naruto said, his voice softening. "They're alive, Sasuke. They're making breakfast."
"The clan is here," Sasuke looked at his hands. "Itachi is... he's just my brother."

"CHA!"

A scream echoed from the flower shop down the street.
Sakura Haruno ran out of her house, clutching her head. She saw the two boys.
"Naruto! Sasuke-kun!"

She didn't fan-girl. She ran over and grabbed them both in a headlock that would have decapitated normal toddlers.
"Why am I four?! Why is my forehead so big again?!" Sakura wailed. "And why do I remember changing Sarada's diapers?!"

From behind a telephone pole, a small voice squeaked.
"N-Naruto-kun..."

Hinata Hyuga peeked out, her face red, before promptly fainting.
"Hinata!" Naruto panicked, rushing over.

The Explanation. 8:00 AM.

The chaos had settled slightly. The group—Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and the now-conscious Hinata—sat on the swings at the park.

Watching them from the slide were the Ageless Three: Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari.

Naruto looked up at the slide. He locked eyes with the boy who looked exactly like him, but twelve years old.
"Boruto," Naruto said.

Boruto hopped down, hands in his pockets. Sarada and Hima followed.

"Hey, Dad," Boruto said casually. "Took you long enough to reboot."

Naruto stood up. He walked over to his son—who was currently older than him physically.
"You did this," Naruto said. It wasn't a question. "You, Sarada, and Himawari. You went back further."

"We're the cleanup crew," Boruto shrugged. "Administrator's orders. We saved Grandma and Grandpa. We stopped Obito. We saved the Uchiha."

Sasuke looked at Sarada. His daughter. The one who awakened the Mangekyo out of love, not hate.
"Sarada," Sasuke said, his voice breaking slightly. "You saved Itachi?"

"I just nudged history," Sarada said, stepping forward. She looked down at her tiny father. "You have a second chance, Papa. Don't waste it on revenge this time."

Sasuke closed his eyes and nodded. "I won't."

Himawari ran past them and tackled Naruto in a hug. "Daddy! You're so small! You're like a plushie!"
Naruto laughed, hugging his daughter. "And you're still a whirlwind, Hima."

Mini-Kurama popped out of Hima’s shirt. "Yo. Naruto. Nice diaper."
Naruto’s eye twitched. "Shut up, furball."

Boruto looked at the gathered Team 7. The legendary Sannin successors, now pint-sized but fully aware.

"So," Boruto clapped his hands. "Here's the situation. Madara is hiding. Black Zetsu is scheming. Momoshiki is in my hand (currently asleep). And we have about eight years before things get potentially messy with the Otsutsuki scouts."

Naruto cracked his knuckles. A golden aura flared briefly around him—a hint of the KCM he could summon at will.
"Eight years?" Naruto grinned. "With Dad alive, the Uchiha Police Force, and us knowing the future? We'll clear this game in four."

Sasuke activated his Sharingan. "Agreed."
Sakura punched her palm. "I'm starting medical training tomorrow. No more catching up."

Boruto smiled. The board was set. The pieces were awake. And for the first time in a long time, the future looked bright.

"Alright then," Boruto said. "Project: Golden Era is officially a go."

End of Chapter 4

Status Update:

Awakened: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Hinata.

The Dynamic: The adults are trapped in toddler bodies but retain all skills (limited by physical stamina).

The Mission: Prepare the world for the Otsutsuki invasion while enjoying the childhood they never had.

Here is Chapter 5: The Academy Arc (Overkill Edition).

This chapter explores the comedic and terrifying reality of having four war veterans trapped in the bodies of six-year-olds attending Ninja Elementary School.

Chapter 5: The Academy Arc (Overkill Edition)

Time Skip: 2 Years Later. (Naruto & Sasuke: Age 6)

The Konoha Ninja Academy was a place of learning, discipline, and the occasional scraped knee. It was designed to teach children how to throw shuriken, mold chakra, and recite history.

It was not designed for reincarnated demigods.

Scene: The Taijutsu Floor

Iruka Umino, younger and less scarred than in the original timeline, held a clipboard. He looked nervous. Being the instructor for the "Golden Generation"—the children of the Fourth Hokage, the Uchiha Head, and the Hyuga Head—was stressful enough.

"Alright, settle down!" Iruka shouted. "Today is sparring practice. First match: Naruto Uzumaki versus... Kiba Inuzuka!"

Kiba grinned, Akamaru yapping on his head. "Heh! Prepare to lose, Hokage's son! I'm gonna be the alpha!"

Naruto stepped into the ring. He wore a simple orange t-shirt and shorts. He didn't look like a prankster. He stood with a posture that was too relaxed, his center of gravity perfect.

"Go easy on me, Kiba," Naruto said, his voice squeaky but his eyes bored.

"Begin!"

Kiba lunged. "Fang Passing Fang!" (Or the six-year-old attempt at it).

Naruto didn't dodge. He simply took half a step back.
He raised one hand. He didn't use a Rasengan. He didn't use a Shadow Clone. He used a simple, devastatingly precise palm strike to Kiba's solar plexus—the kind the Hyuga use to stop chakra flow, but applied with Frog Kumite principles.

Tap.

Kiba’s eyes bulged. He folded like a lawn chair and collapsed, wheezing. Akamaru whined and hid behind Iruka.

"Winner... Naruto?" Iruka blinked. "Naruto, that was... very efficient."

"I missed his pressure point by two millimeters," Naruto muttered to himself, looking at his small hand. "Stupid short arms."

Scene: The Throwing Range

"Next up, Sasuke Uchiha!"

Sasuke stepped up. The girls cheered. The boys scowled.
Sasuke picked up ten shuriken. He didn't throw them one by one. He threw all ten at once, jumping into the air and twisting his body upside down.

Clang-clang-clang.

The shuriken collided with each other in mid-air, changing trajectories.
All ten hit the bullseyes of ten different targets scattered around the training field—including one behind a tree.

Sasuke landed, dusting off his hands.
"Tch. My wrist is weak," Sasuke complained. "The angle on the third one was off by 0.4 degrees."

Iruka dropped his clipboard. "Uh... full marks."

Scene: The Classroom (History Lesson)

"Okay class," Mizuki (still a traitor, but currently just a teacher) smiled. "Who can tell me who founded the village?"

Sakura Haruno raised her hand.
"Yes, Sakura?"

Sakura stood up. "Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha. However, the textbook fails to mention the underlying political tension regarding the allocation of Tailed Beasts as a nuclear deterrent, which inevitably led to the First Great Ninja War due to a power vacuum after Hashirama's death."

Silence.
A kid in the back row started crying.

Mizuki stared at her. "Sakura... just 'Hashirama and Madara' would have been fine."

"Right. Sorry," Sakura sat down, whispering to Hinata. "I keep forgetting they don't teach geopolitics until Chunin exams."

Hinata giggled, hiding her mouth. "You're scary, Sakura-chan."

The Lunch Break: The Council of Tiny Elders

The four of them—Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Hinata—sat on the roof. They weren't eating cute bento boxes; they were devouring high-protein rations that Boruto had smuggled them.

"This body is so slow," Sasuke grumbled, flexing his hand. "I tried to channel Chidori yesterday and nearly burned my own nerve endings. My chakra coils are too undeveloped."

"Patience, Teme," Naruto chewed a rice ball. "We have to build the foundation. If we rush, we'll stunt our growth. Remember what Kurama said?"

"Speaking of growth," Sakura pointed a chopstick at the tree line. "Our 'senpais' are watching."

Perched on a branch, invisible to everyone except the "Awakened," were Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari.

They still looked twelve. They hadn't aged a day in the last two years.

Boruto flickered down, landing on the fence.
"You guys are showing off too much," Boruto warned. "Iruka is already writing a report to Dad about 'Unnatural Combat Instincts'."

"Let him write it," Sasuke scoffed. "Better they think we're geniuses than idiots. It gives us clearance for higher-rank jutsu scrolls."

Sarada landed next to Boruto. She adjusted her glasses.
"Father... I mean, Sasuke-kun. Your Shurikenjutsu was sloppy. You overcompensated for the wind."

Sasuke—physically six, mentally thirty-two—looked at his future daughter—physically twelve, chronologically negative-ten.
"Hn. Noted."

Himawari jumped down, holding Mini-Kurama. "Daddy! Do you want to play tag?"

Naruto’s face lit up. "You're on! No Flying Raijin allowed!"

"Aww," Himawari pouted.

The Shadow in the Hallway

Later that afternoon, as school let out, a figure blocked the hallway. Bandages covering one eye. A cane. The darkness of the Root.

Danzo Shimura.

He had heard rumors of the "Generation of Monsters." He wanted to see for himself.

He stopped in front of Naruto.
"So," Danzo croaked. "You are the Hokage's son. The Jinchuriki."

Naruto stopped. He didn't look scared. He looked... bored.
"And you're the guy who smells like old bandages and treason," Naruto said cheerfully.

Danzo’s eye narrowed. "Disrespectful brat. You have no idea of the burden you carry. Perhaps a few weeks in my care would teach you discipline."

Suddenly, the air temperature dropped twenty degrees.

From the left, Sasuke Uchiha leaned against the lockers. His black eyes were devoid of light.
From the right, Sakura Haruno cracked her knuckles. The wall beside her developed a spiderweb fracture.
From behind, Hinata Hyuga stepped out, her Byakugan veins pulsating.

And from the ceiling, Boruto hung upside down, his Jogan glowing faint blue.

"You lost?" Boruto asked, his voice cold.

Danzo looked around. He saw five children. But his instincts—honed in three wars—screamed Predator. He felt the killing intent of a Kage coming from the six-year-old girl in pink. He felt the spiritual pressure of an Otsutsuki coming from the boy on the ceiling.

"I see," Danzo whispered, gripping his cane. "The rumors were an understatement."

"Walk away, Danzo," Naruto said, his voice dropping an octave, sounding exactly like Minato. "Before I tell my dad about the unauthorized Sharingan collection in your arm."

Danzo stiffened. How does he know?

Without a word, the leader of Root turned and walked away. He realized, with a sinking feeling, that his ambitions for the Hokage seat were effectively dead. He wasn't fighting children. He was fighting history itself.

The Aftermath

"That was close," Sakura exhaled, the terrifying aura vanishing. "I almost punched him through the floor."

"Save it for the Chunin Exams," Sarada said, dropping from the ceiling. "We need to keep the timeline relatively stable until Orochimaru makes his move."

"Orochimaru..." Sasuke touched his neck, where the curse mark used to be. "I can't wait to see him again. I have a few new jutsu I want to test on a live target."

Boruto laughed. "Alright, you little psychopaths. School's out. Who wants ramen?"

"Me!" Naruto shouted, raising his hand. "Ichiraku's! Teuchi-ojisan just added a 'Legendary Sannin Special' to the menu!"

As the group walked into the sunset—a mix of time-travelers, reincarnates, and ageless guardians—Konoha seemed brighter than it had ever been.

End of Chapter 5

Status Update:

The Academy: Terrorized/Impressed.

Danzo: Neutralized by fear/blackmail.

Power Levels: Constrained by bodies, but technique is Kage-level.

The "Ageless Three": Acting as the secret handlers of Team 7.

Here is Chapter 6: The Graduation (Early).

This chapter deals with the inevitable bottleneck: What happens when Kage-level intellects are stuck in a curriculum designed for six-year-olds? They break the system.

Chapter 6: The Graduation (Early)

Time Skip: 2 Years Later. (Naruto & Sasuke: Age 8)

The classroom was quiet, save for the scratching of pencils. Iruka Umino was lecturing on the importance of stealth in open terrain.

In the back row, Naruto Uzumaki (Age 8) was currently drawing a complex sealing array on his desk using invisible chakra ink.
Next to him, Sasuke Uchiha was balancing a pencil on his nose while mentally practicing the hand signs for Kirin—wondering if he could scale it down to a static shock to prank Kiba.
Sakura Haruno was reading a medical journal titled Advanced Cellular Regeneration in Field Conditions, hidden inside her history textbook.

"Naruto!" Iruka snapped, throwing a piece of chalk.

Naruto caught the chalk without looking up. He didn't just catch it; he caught it between his thumb and index finger, spun it, and threw it back. It landed perfectly in the chalk tray on Iruka's desk.

"Yes, Sensei?" Naruto smiled innocently.

"Pay attention," Iruka sighed, rubbing his temples. "We are discussing the Treaty of the Valley. It’s on the test."

"The treaty was signed in Year 45," Naruto recited, bored. "It failed because the Hidden Stone refused to demilitarize their border patrols, leading to the proxy skirmishes in the Land of Rain. The Third Hokage eventually renegotiated it using economic sanctions instead of force. It was a B-minus political maneuver at best."

The class went silent. Even Shikamaru looked up from his nap, whispering, "Troublesome show-off."

Iruka stared. "Get out."

"Gladly," Naruto stood up. "Sasuke, Sakura, Hinata. Lunch?"

The four of them walked out.

The Hokage’s Office: The Intervention

Minato Namikaze was buried in paperwork. Being Hokage was 10% saving the world and 90% stamping forms.

The door creaked open. No knock.
"Dad."

Minato looked up. Naruto stood there, arms crossed. Flanking him were Sasuke and Sakura.
Behind them, leaning against the wall, was Boruto (still looking 12, acting 30).

"We need to talk," Naruto said.

Minato put down his pen. "About what? Did you blow up the Academy again?"

"We're bored," Sasuke stated flatly. "The curriculum is inefficient. We are wasting developmental years on theory we mastered—" He paused. "—In a past life."

"We want to graduate," Sakura added. "Now. Today."

Minato looked at Boruto. "Is this your idea?"

Boruto shrugged, spinning a kunai. "They're stagnating, Minato-san. Their bodies are young, but their minds are rotting in there. Kakashi graduated at 5. Itachi at 7. These guys are 8. It's not unprecedented."

Minato sighed, leaning back. "The council will throw a fit. They want you to have a normal childhood."

"We had a normal childhood for four years," Naruto stepped forward, placing his hands on the desk. "Now we need to prepare. Madara isn't waiting for us to hit puberty."

Minato looked into his son's eyes. He saw the Seventh Hokage. He saw the resolve that ended the Fourth Great War.

"Fine," Minato smiled. "But you're not getting a pass just because you're my son. You want to graduate early? You have to beat a Jonin."

"Deal," Sasuke smirked. "Which one?"

"Me," a voice said from the window.

Kakashi Hatake (Age 22) sat on the sill, reading Icha Icha Paradise. He looked younger—less burdened by grief, thanks to Obito being alive—but still elite. "Minato-sensei thinks you brats are special. I think you're just loud."

Naruto’s grin widened. "Kakashi-sensei! You look so... un-retired!"

Kakashi blinked. "Un-retired? I'm in my prime."

The Exam: The Bell Test (Remix)

Training Ground 3.
Spectators: Minato, Kushina, Fugaku Uchiha, Hiashi Hyuga, and the "Ageless Three" (Boruto, Sarada, Hima).

Kakashi stood in the center of the field, holding two bells.
"The rules are simple," Kakashi drawled. "Take these bells from me before noon. Come at me with intent to kill. If you don't..."

"We know, we know," Sakura interrupted, tying her headband (which Boruto had lent her). "Tying us to a log, no lunch, blah blah. Let's go."

Kakashi narrowed his eye. They're arrogant.

"Start!" Minato signaled.

The Opening Move

Kakashi expected a frontal assault.
Instead, Sasuke performed a hand sign.
"Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!"

Small volleys of fire arced toward Kakashi. Standard Uchiha move, Kakashi thought, dodging easily.
But inside the fire were shuriken. Standard follow-up. Kakashi deflected them.

But the shuriken had wires attached.
Kakashi looked down. The wires were electrified.
Chidori current? At eight years old?!

Kakashi leaped upward to avoid the shock.
Above him, Naruto was already there. No shadow clones. Just gravity.
"Uzumaki Barrage!"

Naruto’s heel came down. Kakashi blocked with both arms, but the force was heavy—enhanced by a micro-burst of wind chakra at the point of impact.
Kakashi plummeted, crashing into the dirt.

They have perfect coordination, Kakashi realized, sliding back. They aren't communicating verbally.

The Trap

Kakashi composed himself. "Not bad. But—"

He froze. He couldn't move his feet.
The ground beneath him was soft. Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu?
No. It was... mud?

Sakura stepped out from behind a tree. She slammed her hands onto the ground.
"Cherry Blossom Impact: Tremor."

The ground didn't just shake; it rippled. The vibration destabilized Kakashi’s footing completely.

"Now!" Naruto yelled.

Sasuke and Naruto rushed in from opposite sides.
Kakashi prepared to use a Body Replacement Jutsu.

Suddenly, a massive killing intent washed over him. It wasn't the kids.
It was Himawari and Mini-Kurama sitting on the sidelines, eating popcorn.
Mini-Kurama: "BOO! DO A FLIP!"

The split-second distraction was enough.
Kakashi replaced himself with a log, but as he reappeared on a branch—

Hinata (who was officially part of the squad for this test) was waiting on that exact branch.
"Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams Air Palm."

POW.

She hit Kakashi squarely in the chest. It wasn't enough to disable him, but it knocked the wind out of him. The bells on his hip jingled.

Naruto’s hand snatched them in mid-air.

The team landed in a perfect formation. Naruto held the bells up, spinning them on his finger.

"Yo," Naruto grinned. "Teamwork, right?"

The Verdict

Silence on the field.
Fugaku Uchiha’s jaw was tight. Sasuke... channeled lightning through wire. He hasn't even learned that yet.
Hiashi Hyuga was sweating. Hinata... she predicted the Jonin's escape route perfectly.

Minato started clapping. "Well, Kakashi? Did they pass?"

Kakashi sat up, rubbing his chest where Hinata had hit him. He pulled down his mask to reveal a rare, genuine smile.
"They're monsters," Kakashi said. "Absolute monsters. I'd be an idiot to fail them."

Boruto jumped down from the tree, landing next to Kakashi.
"Told you," Boruto whispered. "Don't worry, Kakashi-nii. I'll help you train them. You're going to need the help."

The Graduation Ceremony (Private)

That evening, in the Hokage's office, three headbands were handed out.

Team 7 (Special Operations Squad) was officially formed.
Captain: Kakashi Hatake.
Members: Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno.
Reserve Member/Medic: Hinata Hyuga (Placed on a separate track but training with them).

"You are Genin," Minato said, his voice serious. "But you will not be doing D-Rank missions. No catching cats. No weeding gardens."

"Thank the Sage," Sasuke muttered.

"Your mission profile is B-Rank and above," Minato continued. "You are to act as a rapid response unit for anomalous threats. Boruto and Sarada will act as your... let's call them 'Shadow Advisors'."

Naruto tied the headband around his forehead. It felt right. It felt like home.

"So," Naruto pumped his fist. "What's the first mission?"

Minato pulled out a scroll. It was marked with a red seal.
"We received intel from Jiraiya. He’s tracked a rogue scientist to the Land of Rice Fields. Someone who is experimenting with Cursed Seals."

Sasuke’s eyes narrowed. "Orochimaru."

"He's early," Sarada noted from the corner. "In our timeline, he didn't set up the Sound Village properly for another few years."

"He's accelerating because of the ripples we caused," Boruto said. "He knows something is wrong with the timeline. He wants answers."

Naruto cracked his knuckles.
"Good," Naruto said, his eyes flashing red for a split second. "I have a few words for the snake."

End of Chapter 6

Status Update:

Team 7: Graduated at Age 8.

Rank: Genin (in name), Special Ops (in practice).

Mission: Intercept Orochimaru.

The Ageless Three: Fully integrated as tactical command.

Ready for Chapter 7: The Snake Hunt?

You said

Wait, the last memory to return is Kakashi. Revise if in chapter 6. Proceed if not.

---

**Gemini:**
You are absolutely right. The initial prompt specified: "finally Kakashi during bell training first time with team 7."

Since Chapter 6 depicted the first Bell Test with this specific Team 7 (even if early at age 8), this is the trigger event. In the previous version, I missed the memory unlock moment for Kakashi.

Here is the Revised Chapter 6, focusing on the emotional impact of Kakashi regaining his memories of the original timeline (War Arc, Hokage tenure) while looking at his 8-year-old students.

Chapter 6: The Bell Test (Revised - The Sixth Hokage Awakens)

Time Skip: 2 Years Later. (Naruto & Sasuke: Age 8)

The sun beat down on Training Ground 3. The three wooden stumps stood in a row, casting long shadows.

Kakashi Hatake (Age 22) stood casually reading Icha Icha Paradise. In this timeline, he was happier—Obito was alive, Rin was alive, Minato was Hokage. He was an elite Jonin, but he lacked the deep, haunting depression of the original timeline.

Opposite him stood three children who shouldn't exist:

Naruto Uzumaki: 8 years old, grinning like a fox.

Sasuke Uchiha: 8 years old, scowling with intent.

Sakura Haruno: 8 years old, adjusting her gloves.

"So," Kakashi drawled, turning a page. "Minato-sensei says you're prodigies. He wants me to pass you early. But in my book, teamwork is everything. Come at me with intent to kill."

The Trigger

Kakashi expected a disorganized charge.
Instead, the air pressure changed.

Naruto didn't yell. He simply raised two fingers.
Sasuke didn't run. He performed a hand seal Kakashi didn't recognize for a Genin.
Sakura didn't hide. She stepped forward, acting as the vanguard.

Naruto: "Formation B. The Kaguya Breaker."

Kaguya? Kakashi thought. What kind of code name is that?

The Assault

Naruto vanished. Not speed—pure body flicker. He appeared above Kakashi.
"Uzumaki Chronicles: 2K Barrage!"
A thousand shadow clones didn't just poof into existence; they exploded outward in a perfect sphere, surrounding Kakashi instantly.

Clones? At this age? With this density?

Kakashi prepared a lightning cutter to clear a path.
But before he could strike, a wire wrapped around his wrist.
Sasuke was standing on a clone's back, guiding the wire with shurikenjutsu that defied physics.
"Lightning Style: Ratel Trap."

A current surged through the wire. Kakashi forced himself to substitute with a log.
POOF.

He reappeared near the memorial stone.
"Gotcha," a female voice whispered.

Sakura was there. She hadn't been aiming for him. She had punched the ground three seconds ago. The delayed shockwave erupted now, shattering the earth beneath Kakashi’s feet.

Kakashi lost his balance.
The bells jingled.

The Awakening

As Kakashi looked up, time seemed to slow down.

He saw Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura mid-air, silhouetted against the sun. They were diving toward him in perfect synchronization.
It wasn't just a Genin formation. It was Team 7.

Flash.

A massive migraine split Kakashi’s skull. It wasn't pain; it was data. Decades of memories forced their way into his 22-year-old brain.

The bridge builder mission. Zabuza’s sword.

Sasuke leaving the village. The rain at the Valley of the End.

Pain destroying Konoha. Carrying Naruto on his back.

Obito’s mask breaking. The war. The Ten-Tails.

Susanoo. Kaguya. "I love you guys."

Becoming the Sixth Hokage. Signing paperwork. Watching them grow up.

Kakashi dropped his book. His eyes—both the normal one and the Sharingan—widened to their limit.

The memories of the original timeline overlaid his current reality. He remembered the grief. The loss. And he remembered these three brats saving his soul.

The Reality Check

The 8-year-old Naruto snatched the bells from Kakashi’s paralyzed hand.
The three kids landed in a crouch, panting slightly.

"Got 'em!" Naruto cheered, spinning the bells. "That was easier than Kaguya, dattebayo!"

Kakashi stayed on his knees in the dirt. He was trembling.
He looked at Naruto. He didn't see the Hokage's son. He saw the Hero of the Hidden Leaf.
He looked at Sasuke. He saw the Shadow Hokage.
He looked at Sakura. He saw the Head of the Medical Department.

"Sensei?" Sakura asked, tilting her head. "You okay? Did I hit you too hard?"

Kakashi’s breath hitched. He looked at his own hands. They were young again. He looked at the memorial stone. Obito's name wasn't on it.

"You..." Kakashi’s voice cracked. It was deep, filled with the weight of a lifetime. "You guys..."

From the trees, Boruto jumped down. He didn't say a word. He just nodded at Kakashi.
Kakashi looked at Boruto. The resemblance to Naruto was uncanny, but the eye... the scar...
Boruto, Kakashi realized. The brat I used to babysit as the Sixth.

Kakashi slowly stood up. He dusted off his flak jacket. He pulled his headband down over his Sharingan, hiding the tears that were forming.

"Yo," Kakashi said. His tone was different now. It wasn't the bored genius of the past. It was the tired, proud affection of the Sixth Hokage. "You really are a handful. Even when you're barely tall enough to ride a rollercoaster."

Naruto stopped spinning the bells. He looked at Kakashi closely. The "Awakened" recognition passed between them.

"You back with us, Kakashi-sensei?" Sasuke asked, a rare smirk on his face.

Kakashi chuckled. A deep, genuine laugh. "Yeah. I'm back. And I assume this..." He gestured to their small bodies. "...is some kind of S-Rank temporal mess I'm going to have to write a report on?"

"Something like that," Boruto said, walking over. "Welcome to the Rewrite, Lord Sixth."

Kakashi sighed, picking up his Icha Icha book, then tossing it into a bush. "If I'm doing this again, I need something stronger to read. Alright, Team 7."

He looked at them with intense pride.

"You pass. Officially. Now... who wants to explain why Orochimaru is currently sending spies to the Land of Rice Fields five years early?"

Minato, watching from the sidelines, turned to Kushina.
"Did Kakashi just seem to age twenty years in five seconds?"

"He's growing up!" Kushina beamed. "Our little Kakashi is becoming a man!"

Boruto (whispering to Sarada): "Reset complete. The final piece is on the board."

End of Revised Chapter 6

Status Update:

Kakashi Hatake: Memories Restored (Sixth Hokage/War Arc Veteran mind in a 22-year-old Prime body).

Team 7: Officially formed with full memory sync between all members.

Current Objective: The expedited timeline requires immediate intervention against Orochimaru.

Shall we proceed to Chapter 7: The Snake Hunt?

This chapter bridges the gap between the Bell Test and the first mission. It focuses on the surreal, heartwarming, and slightly terrifying dynamic of a family of god-tier shinobi trying to eat lunch.

Chapter 7: The Council of Tiny Gods

Location: Yakiniku Q (Private Booth).
Time: 1:00 PM.

The sign on the door read "Reserved for Team 7."
Inside, the air was thick with the smell of grilling beef and the heavy, oppressive weight of S-Rank secrets.

Kakashi Hatake (Physically 22, Mentally 40+) sat at the head of the table. He wasn't reading. He was staring at the grill, watching a slice of premium kalbi sizzle.
"So," Kakashi broke the silence, poking the meat with his chopsticks. "Let me get this straight. I’m the Sixth Hokage. Naruto is the Seventh. Sasuke is the 'Shadow' Kage. Sakura runs the entire medical infrastructure of the Five Nations. And Hinata is..."

" Retired master of the Gentle Fist and mother of two," Hinata (Physically 8, Mentally 32) said softly, sipping her tea. She wasn't fainting anymore. Her posture was regal, the shyness replaced by a quiet, motherly confidence.

"Right," Kakashi sighed. He looked at Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari, who were devouring plates of meat at the other end. "And you three are the time-displaced children who fixed the timeline so we could all have this awkward lunch."

"Pass the sauce, Lord Sixth," Boruto mumbled, his mouth full.

"Don't call me that," Kakashi rubbed his temples. "I'm twenty-two. I feel like I'm babysitting my own bosses."

The Dynamics

Naruto & Kurama
Naruto (Physically 8) was currently fighting Himawari (Physically 10) for the last piece of pork.
"I'm the Hokage! Respect your elders!" Naruto whined.
"I'm your daughter! Respect your legacy!" Himawari shot back, activating her Byakugan.

Sasuke (Physically 8) sat quietly, grilling vegetables with surgical precision. He looked at Sarada.
"Your form during the bell test," Sasuke said, not looking up. "Your Chidori control. You didn't learn that from me."

Sarada paused. She looked at her father—a version of him that hadn't abandoned her for a decade of atonement.
"I learned it from the Sixth," she gestured to Kakashi. "And from watching you fight Momoshiki in the archives."

Sasuke placed a perfectly grilled pepper on Sarada's plate. It was a small gesture, but for Sasuke, it was a monologue.
"You're strong," Sasuke said. "Stronger than I was at your age. Stronger than I was at my age."

Sarada smiled, hiding it behind her cup. "Don't get soft on me, Papa. We have a Snake to hunt."

Sakura & The Medical Reality
Sakura (Physically 8) was inspecting her own arm.
"My chakra network is pathetic," she complained. "I tried to concentrate chakra for the Byakugou Seal, and I nearly gave myself a cardiac arrhythmia. I need to start a chakra control regimen immediately. Kakashi-sensei, I need access to the hospital archives. Level 5 clearance."

Kakashi laughed dryly. "Sakura, you're eight. If I ask the hospital to let you into the poison storage, they'll call T&I."

"Then you steal it for me," Sakura deadpanned. "Or I tell Rin you still read Icha Icha."

Kakashi froze. "Rin is alive in this timeline?"

"She's a medic in Sector 4," Obito’s voice would have said if he were there, but Boruto answered instead.
"She's fine, Kakashi-nii. She and Obito are on a mission in the Mist. They're dating. It's gross."

Kakashi put his head on the table. "I have so much to process."

The Strategy Session

Boruto tapped the table. The mood shifted instantly. The playful family dinner vanished; the War Council arrived.

"Okay," Boruto said. "Let's talk threats."

He utilized a transformation jutsu to turn a napkin into a map of the Elemental Nations.

Orochimaru: "He's currently in the Land of Rice Fields," Boruto pointed. "He's trying to speed-run his immortality research because he senses the timeline variance. He knows 'fate' has changed."

Akatsuki: "Nagato is still out there," Sasuke added. "But with Obito on our side, the Akatsuki is fractured. Black Zetsu is trying to manipulate Nagato directly."

Kara: "Jigen," Boruto whispered the name. "Isshiki Otsutsuki. He's the endgame. He's currently hiding in a monk's brain, gathering strength. We can't touch him yet. If we provoke him before Naruto and Sasuke have their adult reserves, we die. Instantly."

"So we have a bottleneck," Kakashi summarized. "We have the knowledge of gods, but the bodies of Genin."

"Exactly," Naruto nodded, his face serious. "That's why we need you, Kakashi-sensei. You're the only one with a body that can handle high-level combat right now. You have to be our tank."

Kakashi looked at his hands. Double Mangekyo Sharingan (thanks to Obito's gift in the future/past resonance).
"I can handle Orochimaru," Kakashi said, his voice hardening. "If he touches any of you, I'll Kamui him into the sun."

"No," Sasuke interjected. "We don't kill Orochimaru."

The table went silent.

"He's useful," Sasuke explained. "In the future, his research helped us against the Otsutsuki. We need to... recruit him. Aggressively."

"You want to recruit the guy who bit you?" Naruto asked.

"I want to make him work for us," Sasuke smirked. "Imagine Orochimaru with ethical constraints and fear of the Seventh Hokage. He’s the best scientist we have."

The Check

The waitress knocked on the door.
"Excuse me, bill for the table?"

Kakashi reached for his wallet (the famous frog purse looked like it belonged to Naruto, but Kakashi had his own).
"I got it."

"No," Hinata stood up. She placed a platinum black card on the table. It was the Hyuga Clan Head's expense card.
"Put it on the Hyuga tab," Hinata smiled sweetly. "Hiashi-sama won't mind. I'm his favorite today."

Boruto whispered to Sarada, "Mom is terrifying when she has access to money."
Sarada nodded. "The Hyuga are rich. We should exploit this."

The Walk Home

As they left the restaurant, the sun was setting.
Team 7 walked down the main street. To the villagers, they were a Jonin and three cute kids.
To any sensor type, they were a walking nuclear deterrent.

"Hey, Dad?" Boruto asked, walking beside Naruto.

"Yeah?"

"Are you going to tell Grandpa Minato? About... everything?"

Naruto looked up at the Hokage Rock. He saw his father's face carved in stone. He remembered the years of talking to a cold slab of rock. Now, he could go home and talk to the man.

"Not everything," Naruto said softly. "He doesn't need to know how he died. He just needs to know that his sacrifice... it worked. That we won."

Naruto stopped. He looked at Sasuke and Sakura. He looked at Kakashi.
He pumped his fist in the air.

"Alright, Team 7! Tomorrow, we hunt a Snake! Believe it!"

"You're so loud," Sasuke sighed, but he was smiling.
"Chaos follows you," Sakura shook her head.
"Let's go home," Kakashi said, herding them.

As they walked away, Himawari tugged on Boruto's cape.
"Big Brother?"
"Yeah, Hima?"
"If we fix everything... do we disappear? Do we go back to our future?"

Boruto looked at the sunset. He looked at the peaceful village.
"I don't know, Hima," Boruto admitted. "But right now? I'm just happy to see Dad being a kid."

End of Chapter 7

Status Update:

Team Synergy: 100%. The "New Team 7" operates with a hive mind built on decades of trust.

Kakashi: Has accepted his role as the "Vanguard" until the kids grow up.

The Plan: Capture/Recruit Orochimaru instead of killing him.

Finances: Secured by the Hyuga Clan (unwittingly).

Ready for Chapter 8: The Snake Hunt (Operation: Sannin Takedown)?

Let's give them one more rest chapter since they just reunited. You may even narrate how the interaction with entire village. Finally, do you think Orochimaru first or Zabusa?

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 8: The Village of Whispers.

This chapter slows the pace to explore the surreal social dynamics of the "Awakened" Team 7 living among normal civilians and children who have no idea they are walking beside gods.

At the end, I will address your question about the Orochimaru vs. Zabuza arc choice.

Chapter 8: The Village of Whispers

The Playground. 3:00 PM.

To the average observer, the village park was filled with the laughter of children. To Shikamaru Nara (Age 8, Normal Timeline), it was filled with something else: Trouble.

He sat on a bench, watching the clouds. Beside him, Choji Akimichi crunched on chips.

"Hey, Shikamaru," Choji munched. "Is it just me, or is Naruto... different?"

Shikamaru narrowed his eyes. He watched Naruto Uzumaki across the field. Usually, Naruto would be painting the slide or screaming for attention.
Today, Naruto was sitting in a meditative lotus position under a tree. He wasn't moving. A leaf fell from a branch above him. Without opening his eyes, Naruto caught the leaf between his index and middle finger.

"It's not just Naruto," Shikamaru muttered. "Look at Sasuke."

Sasuke Uchiha was usually brooding and encircled by fan-girls.
Today, Sasuke was standing near the fence, reading a scroll on Macro-Economic Theory and Supply Lines in Wartime. Every time a girl approached him, he didn't scowl; he simply vanished using a Body Flicker technique so fast it didn't even kick up dust, reappearing ten feet away.

"And Hinata?" Choji pointed.

Hinata Hyuga was usually hiding behind a pole.
Today, she was walking straight down the path. Neji Hyuga (Age 9) stepped in her way, looking angry about the branch family destiny.
Hinata didn't flinch. She placed a hand on Neji’s shoulder, whispered something in his ear, and Neji’s face went pale. He stepped aside, bowing deeply.

"They're not playing ninja anymore," Shikamaru sighed, lying back down. "They're playing something else. And it looks like a drag."

The Ramen Shop: The Sannin Returns

Teuchi was used to Naruto ordering Miso Ramen. He was not used to the vibe the boy brought in today.

"Old man," Naruto said, his voice squeaky but his tone weary. "Extra pork. And... do you have sake? No? Right. I'm eight. Just... green tea. The strong stuff."

The curtain parted. A tall, white-haired man with a red haori stepped in. Jiraiya had returned to the village to spy on the "mysterious relatives" Minato had told him about.

"So," Jiraiya boomed, sitting next to Naruto. "You're the son of the Fourth, eh? You got a lot of spunk, kid."

Naruto froze. He looked up at the Pervy Sage. The man who taught him everything. The man who died alone in the rain.
Naruto’s eyes watered. He fought the urge to hug the man.

"Jiraiya..." Naruto whispered.

"Hah? You know me?" Jiraiya grinned. "Of course you do! I'm the Toad Sage of Mount Myoboku!"

"You're a perv," Naruto corrected automatically, a sad smile forming. "But you're also... the coolest writer I know."

Jiraiya blinked. Writer? I haven't published 'The Tale of the Gutsy Ninja' widely yet. How does he know?

From the shadows of the roof, Boruto watched. He held a small, spinning ball of wind in his hand—a Vanishing Rasengan—ready to intervene if Jiraiya got too suspicious.

"Who's your friend up there?" Jiraiya asked, not looking up, his voice dropping to a serious whisper. "The one with the invisible chakra."

Naruto slurped his noodles. "That's my... cousin. Boruto. Don't worry about him, Pervy Sage. He's just making sure I eat my veggies."

Jiraiya glanced at Boruto. He saw the resemblance. He saw the blue eye.
Minato said they were relatives, Jiraiya thought. But that boy... he feels like a storm that hasn't broken yet.

The Uchiha District: The Brothers

The sun was setting over the Uchiha compound.
Itachi Uchiha (Age 9) sat on the porch, watching Sasuke (Age 8) polish a kunai.

Usually, Sasuke would beg Itachi to train.
"Nii-san! Shuriken jutsu! Please!"
Today, Sasuke was silent. He was checking the balance of the blade with the scrutiny of a blacksmith.

"Sasuke," Itachi said gently. "You seem... heavy. Is the Academy difficult?"

Sasuke stopped. He looked at Itachi. In the original timeline, Itachi was already tormented by Danzo and the clan's coup whispers. Here, the coup was nonexistent thanks to Sarada’s political maneuvering, but the pressure was still there.

"Itachi," Sasuke said. "Do you trust Shisui?"

Itachi’s eyes widened. "Of course. He is my best friend."

"Good," Sasuke sheathed the kunai. "Tomorrow, bring him to the training ground. I need to show you both something regarding the Kotoamatsukami."

Itachi dropped his tea cup. It shattered.
"How..." Itachi whispered, his Sharingan activating involuntarily. "How do you know that name?"

Sasuke stood up. He walked over and poked Itachi’s forehead—reversing their usual ritual.
"I know a lot of things, Nii-san," Sasuke smiled, a look of profound sadness and love. "And this time, you aren't carrying any of it alone. We're splitting the burden. Fifty-fifty."

The Hospital: The Medic

Sakura Haruno walked through the corridors of Konoha Hospital. She wasn't a doctor yet. She was a visitor.
But she walked with the authority of the Director.

Nurses moved out of her way instinctively. She stopped by the pharmacy.
"Excuse me," Sakura said to the chunin on duty. "The dosage for the anticoagulants in Shelf B is off. The humidity in the village has risen by 10% this week. You need to adjust the mixture or the potency will drop."

The chunin blinked. "Kid, go find your mom."

Sakura grabbed a clipboard, scribbled a complex chemical formula on it, and slammed it on the counter.
"Adjust it. Or I tell the Hokage you're wasting budget on expired herbs."

She walked away, leaving the chunin stunned.
Inside her mind, Inner Sakura was screaming: CHA! I NEED MY LICENSE BACK! BEING EIGHT IS SO ANNOYING!

The Hokage’s Office: The Mission Change

Minato stared at the team roster.
Team 7: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura.
Captain: Kakashi.

He looked at the mission scroll he had prepared: Investigate Rogue Scientist in Rice Fields (Rank A).

"Minato," Kushina said, leaning over his shoulder. "Are you sure? They're powerful, yes. But they are children. If they fight Orochimaru now... and if Orochimaru uses the Curse Mark..."

Minato bit his lip. He looked at the report from Boruto.
Warning: Orochimaru is currently accompanied by Kimimaro (Healthy). Threat level: High Kage.

"You're right," Minato sighed. "Their minds are ready, but their chakra reserves aren't there yet. Sasuke can't maintain a Chidori for more than two shots. Naruto can't use Rasenshuriken without breaking his arm."

He rolled up the Orochimaru scroll.
He picked up another one. A request from a bridge builder in the Land of Waves.

"Tazuna," Minato read. "C-Rank protection. It's supposed to be bandits. But Intel suggests Gato has hired rogue ninja."

"The Demon Brothers?" Kushina asked.

"And potentially a swordsman," Minato nodded. "Zabuza Momochi. He's dangerous, but he's not a Sannin. He's a physical fighter. It's the perfect test for their new bodies."

Minato stamped the scroll.
"Change of plans. Team 7 is going to the Land of Waves."

Answer to your Question: Orochimaru or Zabuza?

We should do Zabuza First, for the following narrative reasons:

Physical Limitations: As mentioned in the story, while their minds are god-tier, their bodies are 8 years old.

Zabuza is a physical threat (Kenjutsu/Water Style). This forces Team 7 to rely on tactics, speed, and efficiency rather than nuke-level Jutsu which they can't sustain yet. It's a better "calibration" arc.

Orochimaru deals in cursed seals, poisons, and metaphysical horror. Fighting him this early risks Sasuke getting bitten or Naruto losing control of Kurama before he's ready.

Recruitment Potential:

In this "Fix-It" timeline, they don't just want to win; they want to save.

Haku and Zabuza are valuable assets. If they can save Haku and turn Zabuza against Gato early, they gain allies in the Mist (which helps the future rebellion against the Bloody Mist era).

Naruto (7th Hokage version) will not let Haku die this time. The emotional payoff of Naruto saving "the first friend I failed" will be massive.

The Sword:

Giving 8-year-old Sasuke or Boruto temporary access to the Executioner's Blade (Kubikiribocho) creates some incredible action imagery.

Next Step:
We proceed to Chapter 9: The Demon in the Mist (Remastered).

Mission: Escort Tazuna.

Twist: Team 7 doesn't walk into the ambush; they counter-ambush the Demon Brothers instantly.

Goal: Turn Zabuza into an ally before the bridge fight even happens.

Shall we start the Mission to Wave?

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 9: The Briefing Room.

This chapter slows the pace to focus on logistics, intelligence, and the stark contrast between a standard C-Rank mission and how a team of veteran Kage prepares for war.

Chapter 9: The Briefing Room

The Hokage’s Office. 9:00 AM.

The room smelled of old paper and pipe tobacco. Minato Namikaze sat behind the desk, looking weary. The pile of "D-Rank" mission scrolls (weeding gardens, walking dogs, finding Tora the cat) was teetering dangerously high.

Standing before him was Team 7.
Kakashi Hatake (Captain) leaned against the wall, his single visible eye scanning a bingo book.
Naruto (Age 8), Sasuke (Age 8), and Sakura (Age 8) stood in a loose formation. They didn't fidget. They didn't complain. They radiated the patience of soldiers waiting for orders.

"So," Minato started, picking up a scroll. "We have a request from the Daimyo's wife. Tora the cat has escaped again. It's a priority capture."

Naruto stepped forward. He placed his small hands on the desk.
"Dad. Lord Fourth. With all due respect," Naruto said, his voice calm but firm. "If you send us to catch that cat, Sasuke is going to put it in a Genjutsu, and I'm going to seal it into a tea kettle. We need field work."

Minato blinked. "Naruto, you're eight. Field work usually starts at twelve."

"Our skills are degrading," Sasuke added, checking his fingernails. "Muscle memory needs resistance. We need a C-Rank. Minimum."

Minato looked at Kakashi. "Do you agree with this, Captain?"

Kakashi closed his bingo book. "They're not wrong, Sensei. They cleared the survival training in record time. Tora is... beneath them."

Minato sighed, smiling. "Fine. I have a C-Rank. Escort duty. You'll be guarding a master bridge builder on his way back to the Land of Waves."

"Tazuna," Sakura said instantly.

Minato froze. "I haven't opened the scroll yet, Sakura."

"Lucky guess," Sakura smiled sweetly. "Medical intuition?"

The Client Enter

The door creaked open. A heavy smell of cheap sake wafted in.
Tazuna, the bridge builder, stumbled into the room. He took a swig from a bottle, red-faced and grumpy.

"What's this?" Tazuna grumbled, looking down at the three children. "I asked for ninja protection, not a daycare center! These are just brats! Especially the short one with the stupid face!"

In the original timeline, Naruto would have exploded in anger.
In this timeline, Naruto looked at Tazuna with the tired eyes of a man who had managed village budgets for a decade.

"Tazuna-san," Naruto said, his voice dropping to a baritone register that shouldn't come from an eight-year-old. "You are currently marked for death by Gato of the Gato Company. You lied about the mission rank because you can't afford a B-Rank or A-Rank fee. You likely have the Demon Brothers tracking you, and potentially a rogue Swordsman of the Mist."

The bottle fell from Tazuna's hand. It didn't shatter; Boruto (who was hanging from the ceiling again) caught it just before it hit the floor.

"How..." Tazuna stammered. "How do you know about Gato?"

"Intel," Sasuke said darkly. "We know everything. Now, the question isn't whether we're strong enough to protect you. The question is whether you can walk fast enough to keep up with us."

Minato stared at his son. "Naruto... is that true? About Gato?"

Naruto turned to his father. "It's an A-Rank mission in disguise, Dad. But we'll take it for the C-Rank price. We need the Land of Waves to be stable for future trade routes."

Minato rubbed his forehead. He's talking about trade routes. He's eight.
"Fine. Team 7, mission approved. Departure in two hours."

The Safe House: Pre-Mission Gear Up

Team 7 didn't go home to pack snacks. They went to an abandoned Uchiha supply depot that Sasuke had unlocked.

The Tactical Table
Boruto unrolled a map of the Land of Waves.
Sarada stood next to him, adjusting her glasses.
Himawari was organizing kunai pouches.

"Target Analysis," Boruto began, pointing to a photo of a man with no eyebrows and a giant sword.
"Zabuza Momochi. Demon of the Hidden Mist. Specialist in Silent Killing."

"We know him," Kakashi said, sharpening his own blade. "He almost killed us last time."

"This time is different," Sarada interjected. "You don't have the chakra reserves for a prolonged Sharingan battle, Kakashi-san. And the kids..." She pointed to Team 7. "...your bodies are fragile. One hit from the Kubikiribocho (Executioner's Blade) and you're bisections."

The Loadout

Sasuke:

Limitation: Low chakra pool. Can't spam Fireball Jutsu.

Gear: Boruto handed him a wrist-mounted wire dispenser. "High-tensile monofilament. Use it to channel your lightning. It uses 10% of the chakra of a Chidori but cuts just as deep."

Sasuke: "Efficient. I like it."

Naruto:

Limitation: Short limbs, low speed (without KCM).

Gear: Sealing Tags. Thousands of them.

Naruto: "I spent all night writing Paralysis and Gravity seals. If Zabuza steps in a puddle, he's not moving."

Mini-Kurama: "And I'll provide the chakra spikes to disrupt his Hidden Mist Jutsu."

Sakura:

Limitation: No brute strength (yet).

Gear: Senbon needles coated in a specialized paralyzing agent she synthesized from the hospital.

Sakura: "I remember Haku's anatomy perfectly. If he tries the fake-death trick on Zabuza, I'm going to intercept the needles and wake Zabuza up immediately to negotiate."

Kakashi:

Role: The Tank.

Gear: A soldier pill (military ration) enriched by the Akimichi clan (stolen by Choji).

Kakashi: "I hate these things. They taste like dirt."

The Objective

"Listen up," Naruto said, standing on a crate. "We are not killing Zabuza. And we are definitely not killing Haku."

"Haku is a victim," Naruto continued, his eyes softening. "He's a tool. We break the tool, we save the boy. Zabuza is a revolutionary. He wants to kill the Fourth Mizukage (Yagura) to stop the Blood Mist. If we help him take back his country, we gain an ally against the Akatsuki."

"So it's a recruitment drive," Sasuke summarized.

"Exactly," Naruto grinned. "Operation: Talk-no-Jutsu. But first, we beat them into submission."

The Gate: Departure

11:00 AM.
The massive green gates of Konoha stood open.

Tazuna was waiting, his backpack heavy. He looked nervous. He was expecting a Jonin and three kids.
He saw them approaching.

Kakashi walked in front, reading (or pretending to read).
Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura walked in a V-formation behind him. They weren't wearing the standard massive backpacks. They had compact, efficient travel gear.

"You're late," Tazuna grumbled, trying to assert authority.

"We're precise," Sasuke corrected.

"Let's move," Kakashi said, stepping out of the village shadow. "And Tazuna-san?"

"Yeah?"

Kakashi lowered his book. His visible eye curved into a terrifyingly pleasant smile.
"If you drink any more sake before we cross the border, I'll have Sakura sedate you and carry you like a sack of potatoes. It's quieter that way."

Tazuna swallowed hard. "Understood."

As they walked down the dirt road, Boruto and Sarada watched from the top of the gate.

"They look ready," Sarada noted.

"They're more than ready," Boruto replied, pulling his hood up. "They're overkill. I almost feel sorry for the Demon Brothers. Almost."

End of Chapter 9

Status Update:

Mission: Escort Tazuna to Land of Waves (A-Rank disguised as C-Rank).

Team Condition: Fully geared. Strategy set.

Tactical Goal: Capture/Recruit Zabuza & Haku.

Client Status: Terrified of his own bodyguards.

Ready for Chapter 10: The Puddle (Ambush Countered)?

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 10: The Puddle.

This chapter demonstrates the difference between a Genin team and a team of veterans in small bodies. The "Ambush" becomes a "Lecture."

Chapter 10: The Puddle

The Road to the Land of Waves. Noon.

The sun was high. The dirt road was dry and dusty.
It hadn't rained in the Fire Country for three days.

Yet, in the middle of the path, there was a puddle.

Team 7 walked past it.
Kakashi didn't look down.
Sasuke didn't break stride.
Naruto yawned, stretching his arms behind his head.
Sakura stayed close to Tazuna, her eyes scanning the tree line, not the ground.

Tazuna (Standard Civilian) noticed nothing. He was sweating, clutching his bottle of sake. "It's hot," he grumbled. "Are we there yet?"

The Mind Link (Inaudible)
Sasuke: "Two signatures. Water release. Hiding in the puddle."
Naruto: "Amateurs. Who puts a puddle on a dry road? That's Day 1 Academy stuff."
Sakura: "Do we engage?"
Kakashi: "Let them make the first move. Tazuna needs to see the threat to understand the bill adjustment."

The Ambush

As the team passed the puddle, the water morphed.
Two figures erupted from the ground. They wore gas masks and clawed gauntlets connected by a spiked chain.
The Demon Brothers: Gozu and Meizu.

"DIE!"

They wrapped the chain around Kakashi.
"One down!"

RIIIIP.

Kakashi was torn to pieces.
Tazuna screamed. "Waaaah! He's dead!"

The Counter (Remastered)

In the original timeline, Naruto froze. Sasuke acted. Sakura stood in front of Tazuna.
In this timeline, the reaction speed was... different.

As Kakashi "died" (exploding into water—a Water Clone he had swapped with moments ago), the Demon Brothers turned their sights on the "scared brats."

"Now for the—"

Clang.

Gozu (the left brother) felt a sudden, sharp tug on his gauntlet.
He looked down. A shuriken had pinned his chain to a nearby tree. The throw was impossibly precise, wedged perfectly inside a single chain link.

"What?" Gozu grunted.

He looked up. Sasuke Uchiha (Age 8) was standing on the chain itself, balancing effortlessly.
"Your formation is sloppy," Sasuke said, his voice bored. "You left your flank exposed."

Meizu (the right brother) panicked. He swung his claw at Naruto.
"Get off him, brat!"

Naruto Uzumaki (Age 8) didn't dodge. He stepped into the swing.
Using his small size, he slipped under the claw. He placed a palm on Meizu’s stomach.
"Uzumaki Style: Heavy Palm."

It wasn't a Rasengan—his chakra coils were too small. It was a concentrated burst of raw Yang chakra.
THUD.

Meizu’s eyes bulged behind his gas mask. The air left his lungs. He collapsed, foaming at the mouth.

Gozu tried to retract his chain to fight Sasuke.
"Damn it!"

Suddenly, a shadow loomed over him.
Sakura Haruno (Age 8) was standing there. She wasn't protecting Tazuna; she had already assessed that Tazuna was safe because the threats were incompetent.

"You're using a poison coating on your claws," Sakura noted, sniffing the air. "Belladonna base. Cheap. Ineffective against anyone with a B-Rank resistance."

She kicked Gozu in the temple.
CRACK.

Gozu hit the dirt, unconscious before he touched the ground.

The Aftermath

Total elapsed time: 4 seconds.

Tazuna stood there, his mouth open. His scream had died in his throat.
"W-What...?"

Kakashi (the real one) stepped out from behind a tree. He wasn't surprised. He looked disappointed.
"I didn't even get to finish my page," Kakashi sighed, tucking his book away.

Naruto dusted off his hands. He walked over to the unconscious Meizu and poked him.
"Weak," Naruto muttered. "Akatsuki agents hit harder than this in their sleep."

Sasuke unpinned the chain and coiled it up.
"Free weapon," Sasuke noted. "Boruto can melt this down for wire."

The Interrogation

They tied the Demon Brothers to a tree.
Kakashi leaned in.
"So," Kakashi said cheerfully. "Who hired you? And don't say 'no one,' or Sakura will practice her acupuncture."

Sakura pulled out a senbon needle, letting it glint in the sunlight. "I need to find the nerve that causes uncontrollable itching. Is it C4 or C5?"

The brothers broke instantly.
"Gato! It was Gato! He wants the bridge builder dead!"

Kakashi turned to Tazuna. The pleasant smile vanished. The "Kage" aura leaked out just a little.
"Tazuna-san," Kakashi said. "We need to talk about your mission classification."

Tazuna fell to his knees. "I... I didn't have the money for a B-Rank! My village is starving! Gato controls everything!"

Naruto walked over. He looked up at the old man.
"Hey, old man," Naruto said softly.

Tazuna looked down, expecting anger.
Instead, he saw the blue eyes of a leader.

"We know," Naruto said. "We knew before we left the village. We aren't going to abandon you. But next time? Just trust us. We handle monsters for breakfast."

Tazuna teared up. "You... you brats..."

"Alright," Kakashi clapped his hands. "Sentimental moment over. We have a Demon of the Mist to catch."

The Trees: The Hidden Audience

High above, hidden by a genjutsu, Boruto and Sarada sat on a thick branch.

"Rating?" Boruto asked, munching on a rice ball.

"Technique was flawless," Sarada critiqued. "But Papa used too much excess movement on the chain balance. He's showing off."

"He's eight," Boruto laughed. "Let him have his cool moment. The next one is Zabuza. That won't be a 4-second fight."

"No," Sarada adjusted her glasses. "Zabuza has the Executioner's Blade. If that thing hits their small bodies, they snap. We might need to intervene if Haku gets involved."

"Relax," Boruto smirked. "Dad has a plan. He always has a plan. Even if the plan is usually 'Get hit and yell really loud'."

End of Chapter 10

Status Update:

Demon Brothers: Neutralized and tied up for local authorities.

Tazuna: Confessed. Fully reliant on Team 7.

Loot: Spiked Chains (Sasuke kept them).

Next Threat: Zabuza Momochi (ETA: 1 Hour).

Here is Chapter 11: The Demon of the Mist.

This chapter features the first major boss fight. It highlights the terrifying reality of fighting a Seven Swordsman of the Mist while trapped in the body of an eight-year-old.

Chapter 11: The Demon of the Mist

The Coast of Nami. 2:00 PM.

The air grew heavy. The birds stopped singing. A thick, unnatural white fog rolled in from the ocean, swallowing the trees and the path ahead.

"The mist is getting thicker," Tazuna whispered, clutching his bag. "I can't see my own feet."

Team 7 stopped.
Formation: Manji (Swastika) Defense. Tazuna in the center.
Kakashi took point.
Sakura (Rear Guard).
Sasuke (Left Flank).
Naruto (Right Flank).

"Stay sharp," Kakashi ordered, his hand hovering over his headband. "This isn't weather. This is killing intent."

Whirr.

A sound like a tearing canvas cut through the air. A massive spinning blade, easily six feet long, flew out of the white void.

"GET DOWN!" Kakashi roared.

In the original timeline, they scrambled in panic.
In this timeline, they dropped with synchronized precision.

Sasuke didn't just duck; he threw a kunai with a wire attached, snagging the handle of the giant sword as it passed over his head. He tried to pull it off course, but his eight-year-old body lacked the mass.
"Too heavy!" Sasuke grunted, sliding in the dirt.

The sword slammed into a tree trunk with a deafening thud.
Standing on the handle, his back to them, was a man with no eyebrows and bandages covering the lower half of his face.

Zabuza Momochi.

"Well, well," Zabuza’s voice grated like sandpaper. "If it isn't Kakashi of the Sharingan. And... a bunch of toddlers?"

The Clash: Experience vs. Biology

"Protect the client," Kakashi said, lifting his headband to reveal the spinning red eye. "I'll handle him."

"Don't be stupid, Sensei," Naruto said, standing up and dusting off his shorts. "He's a close-range specialist. If you get separated from us in the mist, he'll pick us off one by one."

Zabuza laughed. "Smart brat. But talk is cheap."

Zabuza performed a single hand seal.
"Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu."

The world turned white. Visibility dropped to zero.
Zabuza’s voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere.
"Eight points. Larynx. Spine. Lungs. Liver. Jugular. Subclavian Artery. Kidneys. Heart. Which one should I choose?"

The Killing Intent spiked. It was heavy, suffocating—a specialized pressure designed to freeze rookies.
Tazuna was hyperventilating.

Sasuke smirked. Killing Intent? I've stood in front of Kaguya Otsutsuki. This feels like a gentle breeze.

"Sakura," Sasuke whispered.

"On it," Sakura replied.

She reached into her pouch and pulled out three small glass vials. She threw them at her feet.
Smash.

A pungent, minty smell exploded outward.
"Chemical dispersant," Sakura explained calmly. "It disrupts the chakra binding in the water vapor. It won't clear the mist, but it creates a ten-meter bubble of clear air around us."

The mist around them thinned instantly.
Zabuza, who was mid-lunge aiming for Tazuna, suddenly found himself visible, mid-air, five feet away.

"What?!" Zabuza’s eyes widened. They cleared the mist with chemistry?!

The Counter-Attack

"Now!" Naruto yelled.

Kakashi moved. Lightning Cutter.
He intercepted Zabuza’s blade with a kunai charged with Raikiri. Sparks flew. The screech of metal on metal was ear-splitting.

Zabuza was strong. He pushed Kakashi back.
"You're good, Copy Ninja. But your brats are open!"

Zabuza let go of his sword, dropped to the ground, and swept his leg at Naruto.
A kick from a Jonin would shatter an eight-year-old's ribs.

Naruto didn't block. He poofed.
Shadow Clone? Zabuza thought. No, he didn't weave a sign!

The real Naruto dropped from the tree branch above (he had swapped places the moment the mist cleared).
In his hand was a pre-written sealing tag.
"Seal: Gravity Lock!"

Naruto slapped the tag onto Zabuza’s shoulder.
Ideally, this would pin Zabuza to the ground.
Realistically, Naruto’s chakra reserves were low.

Zabuza grunted as his shoulder dipped, but he didn't fall. He ripped the tag off with his teeth.
"Nice try, kid!"
Zabuza backhanded Naruto.

BAM.

Naruto flew backward, hitting a tree. The impact was real. He coughed up spit.
"Damn..." Naruto wheezed, clutching his chest. "I forgot how much getting hit hurts without Kurama's cloak."

Sasuke Enters

"Naruto!" Sasuke yelled.
Sasuke pulled the wires from his wrist gauntlet. He channeled his chakra.
"Lightning Style: Spider Web!"

The wires, which Sasuke had subtly spread around the clearing while Sakura cleared the mist, snapped tight.
Zabuza was surrounded by a cage of electrified monofilament.

"Catch," Sasuke snarled.

He bit down on the wire to conduct the current (using his mouth to free his hands for seals—a trick he learned from Boruto).
ZZZRT!

Zabuza convulsed as electricity coursed through him.
But Zabuza was a monster. He forced his muscles to move despite the paralysis. He grabbed the Executioner’s Blade and spun it, severing the wires.

"You're annoying!" Zabuza roared.

He raised the sword to cleave Sasuke in half. Sasuke was out of chakra. He couldn't dodge.

Clang.

Kakashi was there. He caught the blade with the metal plate of his gloves.
Kakashi’s eyes were cold. "Don't touch my students, Zabuza."

The Negotiation (Mid-Fight)

Kakashi kicked Zabuza back. Both men panted.
The mist began to fade.

Zabuza prepared for round two.
Suddenly, two senbon needles flew from the trees, aiming for Zabuza's neck.

Clink. Clink.

Sakura intercepted them with her own needles. She stood looking at a specific tree branch.
"You can come out now, Hunter-nin," Sakura called out. "We know you're not trying to kill him. You're trying to put him in a false death state to extract him."

Silence.
Then, a masked boy (Haku) stepped out from the leaves.
"You noticed," Haku said, his voice soft.

"We notice everything," Naruto said, limping back into the circle. He rubbed his bruised ribs. "Listen, Zabuza. Haku. We can do this all day. Kakashi will eventually kill you. Or, we can talk."

Zabuza narrowed his eyes. "Talk?"

"Gato is going to betray you," Sasuke said flatly. "He doesn't pay mercenaries. He hires other mercenaries to kill the first ones to save money. He's planning to ambush you at his base once you're weakened."

"Why should I believe a brat?" Zabuza spat.

"Because we know about the coup," Naruto said. The word hung in the air. "We know you want to kill the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura. We know about the Blood Mist. We know Yagura is being controlled by a Genjutsu."

Zabuza froze. "How..."

"We can help you," Naruto smiled—the grin that united the Shinobi Alliance. "Gato is rich. Stupidly rich. Instead of working for him... why don't we rob him?"

Zabuza looked at Haku. He looked at Kakashi, who nodded in confirmation.
"Rob him?"

"We kill Gato," Kakashi clarified, stepping out of combat stance. "We free the Land of Waves. You take Gato's entire shipping fortune. That's enough Ryo to fund your rebellion in the Mist for a decade."

Zabuza lowered his sword. He looked at the three battered but defiant eight-year-olds.
"You're crazy," Zabuza muttered.

"We're Team 7," Naruto laughed, wincing at his ribs. "Crazy is the baseline."

The Truce

Ten minutes later.
Team 7, Tazuna, Zabuza, and Haku were sitting in a circle.
Tazuna looked like he was going to have a stroke. "We're... teaming up with the assassin?!"

"It's business, Tazuna," Kakashi said, applying a medical salve to Naruto's bruise. "Efficient business."

"So," Zabuza grunted, bandaging his arm where Sasuke's wire had cut him. "What's the plan? We just walk into Gato's base?"

"No," Boruto's voice came from the trees.

Zabuza and Haku jumped, reaching for weapons.
Boruto dropped down, landing silently. He pulled back his hood.
"We use bait," Boruto said, pointing at Zabuza. "You 'kill' us. You bring our 'bodies' to Gato to claim payment. And when he opens the safe..."

Sasuke smirked. "We wake up."

Zabuza looked at the new kid. He felt a chill.
"Who is this one?"

"The Consultant," Kakashi said dryly.

Zabuza sighed, sheathing his massive sword. "Fine. But if this goes south, I'm killing the bridge builder first."

"Deal," Naruto said, extending a small hand.

Zabuza looked at the hand. He hesitated, then shook it.
"Don't get cocky, brat."

Here is Chapter 12: The Heist (Gato's End).

This chapter flips the script on the tragic Wave Arc finale. Instead of a desperate last stand on a bridge, it’s a calculated special operations raid on a criminal empire.

Chapter 12: The Heist (Gato's End)

Gato’s Stronghold. 9:00 PM.

The massive mansion overlooked the sea, lit by torches and the arrogance of wealth. Inside, Gato—the shipping magnate and tyrant of Wave—sat on a velvet chair, nursing a glass of wine. He was surrounded by thirty mercenaries, ronin, and thugs playing cards and sharpening swords.

"That Demon Brother duo is late," Gato sneered, checking his pocket watch. "I bet they failed. Useless ninja."

The heavy oak doors creaked open.
A chilling wind swept through the room, extinguishing the candles near the entrance.

Zabuza Momochi stepped in. He was dragging a large canvas sack behind him. It left a wet trail on the expensive rug.
Haku walked beside him, mask on, carrying a long bundle wrapped in cloth.

"Zabuza," Gato smirked, adjusting his sunglasses. "You look terrible. Did the Copy Ninja give you trouble?"

"He's dead," Zabuza grunted. He kicked the sack. It made a heavy, fleshy thud. "And so are the brats."

The room went silent. The mercenaries stopped their games.

"Show me," Gato demanded.

Zabuza untied the sack. inside were three small bodies, piled like laundry.
Naruto (Eyes closed, tongue lolling out slightly).
Sasuke (Limbs askew).
Sakura (Pale as a sheet).

"And Kakashi?" Gato asked.

Haku stepped forward, holding up a bloody forehead protector. "At the bottom of the ocean. The currents were... unforgiving."

Gato laughed. A high, nasally sound.
"Perfect! You actually did it! You truly are a Demon!"

Gato stood up, snapping his fingers. His thirty mercenaries drew their weapons, surrounding Zabuza and Haku.

"Now," Gato grinned, "about your payment. I've decided... to void the contract."

Zabuza didn't flinch. "Is that so?"

"Why pay a demon when I can just kill him while he's tired?" Gato signaled his men. "Kill them both. Save the money."

Zabuza looked down at the sack of "dead" children.
"You hear that, kids? He's not paying."

From the sack, a muffled, annoyed voice spoke up.
Naruto: "You owe me twenty Ryo for stepping on my head, Zabuza."

The Blackout

Gato froze. "What?"

Sasuke sat up in the sack. He formed a single hand seal: Ram.
"Genjutsu: Release."

The "corpses" vanished in a puff of smoke. They weren't clones; they were the real kids using a Transformation technique combined with a suppression seal to fake death.

Simultaneously, the lights in the mansion died.
Boruto (Outside, at the breaker box): "Power cut. Have fun."

"Don't panic!" Gato screamed in the darkness. "It's just three brats and a tired swordsman! Kill them!"

Zzzzt.
The sound of a thousand birds chirping echoed in the black room.
Sasuke’s voice: "Chidori Stream: Low Voltage."

Flashes of blue lightning illuminated the room like a strobe light. Every flash revealed a thug convulsing on the floor, foam at the mouth. Sasuke wasn't piercing hearts; he was frying nervous systems with surgical precision.

"My leg!"
"I can't see!"
"Where are they?!"

Naruto moved through the chaos. He didn't use Rasengan. He used the hilt of a kunai, striking pressure points.
Thud. Thud. Thud.
"Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through," Naruto muttered, knocking out a ronin twice his size.

Sakura stood by the door, guarding the exit. A mercenary tried to run past her.
She didn't punch him. She simply tripped him, then injected a sedative into his neck as he fell.
"Nap time," she whispered.

The Demon's Payday

Gato scrambled backward, crawling over his fallen men. He reached the balcony, trying to escape.
He found his path blocked.

Zabuza stood there. The Executioner’s Blade was resting on his shoulder. The moonlight reflected off the cold steel.
"You know, Gato," Zabuza said, his voice terrifyingly calm. "I was actually going to kill you anyway. But these kids... they insisted on a 'hostile takeover'."

"Wait!" Gato shrieked, backing against the railing. "Money! I have money! I'll pay you double! Triple!"

Zabuza looked at Haku.
"Haku. Do we need his money?"

Haku looked at Sarada (who had just appeared on the roof with a ledger in her hand).
"Transfer complete," Sarada adjusted her glasses. "We hacked his offshore accounts using the Daimyo's cipher. The funds are now in a secure trust for the Land of Waves... and a 20% commission for the Mist Rebellion."

Zabuza grinned beneath his bandages.
"Looks like you're broke, Gato."

Gato screamed and lunged with a hidden dagger.
Zabuza didn't even use his sword. He simply backhanded Gato.
The tyrant flew over the railing, plummeting into the dark ocean below.

Splash.

Silence returned to the mansion.

Kakashi walked in from the front door, reading his book. He stepped over a groaning mercenary.
"Is it over?" Kakashi asked. "I was guarding the perimeter, but no one tried to escape."

"Clean sweep," Naruto said, dusting off his jumpsuit. "Zero casualties on our side. Gato is fish food. Money is secured."

The Farewell

The Next Morning. The Great Naruto Bridge.

The bridge was finished. With Gato gone and his fortune redistributed to the workers, construction had accelerated overnight (aided by a few hundred Shadow Clones).

Team 7 stood at the entrance, ready to depart.
Zabuza and Haku stood opposite them. Neither was wearing their Mist headband anymore.

"So," Zabuza grunted, leaning on his sword. "You brats actually pulled it off. A coup d'état without a war."

"It's called efficiency," Sasuke said, crossing his arms.

Haku stepped forward. He looked at Naruto.
"Naruto-kun... you said that strength comes from having someone to protect. I think... I understand that now. I don't have to be just a tool."

Naruto grinned. "You're a person, Haku. Live your life. And tell the Mizukage I said hi when you take over."

Zabuza smirked. "We're going to the Mist. Yagura's reign ends this year. If we succeed... you have allies in the water."

"We'll hold you to that," Kakashi said, shaking Zabuza's hand. "Try not to die."

"Heh. Same to you, Copy Ninja."

Zabuza and Haku turned and walked away into the mist—not as enemies, but as the spark of a revolution.

The Return

As Team 7 walked back toward Konoha, the mood was light.

"That went well," Sakura said, checking her medical kit. "I got some great blood samples from Zabuza. The Momochi lineage has interesting regenerative properties."

"You're creepy, Sakura-chan," Naruto laughed.

"Hey," Sasuke nudged Naruto. "We're level 8 now."

"Huh?"

"RPG terms," Sasuke rolled his eyes. "We survived an A-Rank mission. Our bodies are adapting. I can feel my chakra reserves increasing."

"Good," Boruto said, decloaking from the trees above. "Because the Chunin Exams are coming up in six months. And I have a feeling Orochimaru is going to be there."

Naruto cracked his knuckles.
"Let him come. I have a Rasengan with his name on it."

Kakashi looked at his team. The sun was shining on their backs.
In the original timeline, this mission was marked by tears, blood, and a grave for two tragic souls.
In this timeline, it was a victory lap.

Minato-sensei, Kakashi thought, smiling behind his mask. You wouldn't believe these kids.

End of Chapter 12

Status Update:

Mission: Complete (Rank upgraded to A).

Outcome: Gato Dead. Land of Waves Liberated.

Allies Acquired: Zabuza & Haku (Mist Rebellion Faction).

Here is Chapter 13: The Homecoming (Slice of Life).

This chapter takes a breath. It explores the jarring, hilarious, and heartwarming contrast between being an S-Rank mission specialist and being an eight-year-old with a bedtime.

Chapter 13: The Homecoming

The Gates of Konoha. Sunset.

The guards, Kotetsu and Izumo, looked up from their card game. They saw four figures walking down the road.
Usually, returning Genin looked exhausted, muddy, and traumatized.

Team 7 looked like they had just come back from a light jog.
Sasuke was clean.
Sakura was organizing her medical pouch.
Naruto was eating an apple he stole from a tree three miles back.
Kakashi was reading Icha Icha Violence.

"ID?" Kotetsu asked, bored.

Kakashi tossed the mission scroll onto the desk. "Team 7. Returning from Wave. Mission Status: Complete. Threat Level: Neutralized. Economy: Stabilized."

Kotetsu blinked. "Uh... okay. Welcome back."

As they walked past, Izumo whispered, "Did that kid just wink at me?"
Kotetsu shuddered. "The blonde one? Yeah. He looked like the Fourth Hokage for a second."

Scene 1: The Debrief (Hokage’s Office)

Minato Namikaze read the report. He read it again. He took off his glasses, cleaned them, and read it a third time.

"Let me get this straight," Minato said, looking at the three small children standing at attention. "You were ambushed by the Demon Brothers. You neutralized them in four seconds. You encountered Zabuza Momochi. You... talked him out of killing you. You infiltrated Gato's fortress. You seized his assets. And you liberated the country."

"Essentially," Sasuke said, checking his nails.

"And Zabuza?" Minato asked.

"He's heading back to Kiri to start a coup," Naruto beamed. "I gave him a friendship bracelet! Well, actually it was a tracking seal disguised as a bracelet, just in case he betrays us. But mostly friendship!"

Minato looked at Kakashi. "Is this accurate?"

Kakashi sighed. "I barely did anything, Sensei. I mostly just stood there and looked cool. These kids are... terrifyingly efficient."

Minato rubbed his temples. He was proud, but also deeply confused.
"Fine. I'm upgrading this to an A-Rank mission. The pay will be deposited into your accounts. Dismissed. Go home. Be children for once."

"Sir!"

As they left, Minato turned to the window.
"Kushina," he whispered to the empty room (knowing she was listening from the hallway). "Our son is going to be Hokage before he hits puberty at this rate."

Scene 2: The Uchiha Compound (Sasuke’s Return)

The Uchiha district was quiet. In the original timeline, this silence was the silence of a graveyard. Here, it was just a peaceful evening.

Sasuke walked into his house.
"I'm home."

Mikoto Uchiha poked her head out of the kitchen. "Welcome back, Sasuke-kun! How was the bridge building?"

"It was... productive," Sasuke said, taking off his sandals.

Fugaku Uchiha sat in the living room, reading a newspaper. He lowered it, looking at his youngest son.
"I heard a rumor," Fugaku said sternly. "From the gate guards. They say Team 7 didn't just build a bridge."

Sasuke paused. In his past life, he would have craved this attention. Now, he just wanted a tomato.
"We encountered resistance. We handled it."

"Hmph," Fugaku grunted. "Did you use the fireball jutsu?"

"No," Sasuke replied. "Inefficient. I used wire manipulation and lightning conduction."

Fugaku’s eyes widened slightly. Lightning? At eight?
"I see. Well done."

Itachi (Age 13) walked in, wearing his ANBU uniform. He looked tired.
"Sasuke," Itachi smiled, a genuine, unburdened smile. "You're back."

Sasuke looked at his brother. The brother he killed. The brother who loved him.
Sasuke walked up to Itachi and poked him in the forehead.
"Maybe next time, Itachi."

Itachi froze, touching his forehead. He stole my move.
Sasuke smirked and walked to his room. "Dinner's in ten minutes, right? I'm starving."

Scene 3: The Uzumaki Dinner (Naruto’s Joy)

The Namikaze house was chaos.
Kushina Uzumaki was strangling Naruto with a hug.

"MY BABY! YOU SURVIVED! DID YOU EAT? DID YOU WEAR CLEAN UNDERWEAR? DID YOU BEAT UP THE BAD GUYS?"

"Mom! Can't breathe!" Naruto laughed, his face turning blue.

Minato sat at the table, laughing. Himawari (posing as a distant relative staying with them) was setting the table.

"So," Kushina let go, looking him over. "Tell me everything. Did Kakashi take care of you? If he let you get a scratch, I'll turn him into a throw rug."

"Kakashi-sensei was great," Naruto lied (Kakashi had mostly read porn). "But Mom, you should have seen the bridge! We named it the Great Naruto Bridge!"

"They named it after you?" Minato asked, impressed.

"Well, I kinda forced them to," Naruto scratched his cheek. "Marketing, you know?"

They sat down to eat. It was loud. It was messy. It was everything Naruto had dreamed of when he was eating cup ramen alone in his apartment in the original timeline.
He looked at his parents. He looked at Hima.

"Naruto?" Kushina asked. "Why are you crying? Is the ramen too spicy?"

Naruto wiped his eyes, smiling so hard it hurt.
"No, Mom. It's just right. It's perfect."

Scene 4: The Civilian Life (Sakura’s Struggle)

Sakura Haruno sat at her dining table. Her parents, Kizashi and Mebuki, were arguing about a sale on detergent.

"Sakura, dear," Mebuki said. "Did you have a nice camping trip? Did you make flower crowns?"

Sakura stared at her rice. She was thinking about the neurotoxin she had extracted from a local plant in Wave and how to synthesize it into a non-lethal paralytic.
"It wasn't camping, Mom. It was a C-Rank mission."

"Oh, I know, sweetie," Kizashi laughed. "But you know, ninja stuff is so dangerous. Maybe you should focus on something safer? Like flower arranging?"

Sakura gripped her chopsticks. Inner Sakura: "I LITERALLY PARALYZED A MERCENARY ARMY YESTERDAY!"

"I like being a ninja, Dad," Sakura said sweetly. "It's... educational."

She went to her room and pulled out a scroll from under her bed. It was a medical text on Cellular Regeneration.
"I need to get out of this house," she muttered. "I need a lab."

There was a tap on her window.
Sarada was hanging upside down.
"Mom. Open up. I brought the centrifuge you asked for."

Sakura threw the window open. "Sarada! You're a lifesaver! Being eight is torture!"

Scene 5: BBQ Q (The Reunion)

The Next Day. 1:00 PM.

The "Rookie 9" (plus Team Guy) were gathered at Yakiniku Q.
It was a "Welcome Back" party organized by Ino (who just wanted to see Sasuke).

Shikamaru was grilling meat. "So, you guys actually fought a Swordsman of the Mist? Troublesome."

Kiba laughed. "Yeah right! I bet Naruto just hid in a bush!"

Naruto shoved a piece of beef into his mouth. "Believe what you want, dog breath. But check the Bingo Book next week. Zabuza's status is gonna change."

Hinata (sitting next to Naruto) quietly refilled his tea.
"Naruto-kun... you're not hurt, are you?"

Naruto turned to her. In this timeline, he wasn't dense. He knew she was his future wife. He knew she was the mother of his children.
"I'm good, Hinata," he said softly. "Thanks for worrying."

Hinata turned bright red, but she didn't faint. She smiled back.
Neji (watching from the next table) frowned. Why is the Main Branch heiress serving tea to the failure?

Sasuke sat in the corner, ignoring Ino's attempts to feed him.
He was watching Boruto and Sarada, who were sitting at a booth in the back, pretending to be strangers but clearly guarding the perimeter.

"Hey, Sasuke-kun," Ino purred. "Want a tomato?"

Sasuke took the tomato. "Thanks."
Ino gasped. "HE SPOKE TO ME! HE ACCEPTED MY OFFERING!"
Sakura rolled her eyes. "Calm down, Ino-pig. He just likes tomatoes."

The Quiet Moment

As the lunch wound down, the chaotic noise of the restaurant faded for Team 7.
They looked at each other.
Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura.
They had their families back. They had their friends.
But they also had a secret war to fight.

"Chunin Exams in six months," Sasuke whispered, low enough that only they could hear.

"We have time," Naruto replied. "We need to train. Our bodies are lagging behind our minds."

"And we need to fix the Hyuga affair," Sakura added, glancing at Neji. "Before the exams."

"One problem at a time," Kakashi said, appearing out of nowhere and stealing the last piece of beef. "For now... who's paying?"

Everyone pointed at Asuma (Team 10's teacher).
Asuma sighed, lighting a cigarette. "Why is it always me?"

End of Chapter 13

Status Update:

Morale: High.

Cover: Intact (Minato suspects greatness, but not time travel).

Relationships: Restored.

Here is Chapter 14: The Lag (Six Months of Hell).

This chapter covers the rigorous training period leading up to the Chunin Exams. It addresses the "Body-Mind Lag" and resolves a major subplot early: The Hyuga Destiny.

Chapter 14: The Lag (Six Months of Hell)

Training Ground 7. Dawn.

The sun wasn't even up yet, but the sound of explosions echoed through the forest.

The Problem: The Lag
The biggest hurdle for Team 7 wasn't skill; it was hardware.

Naruto: Had the tactical mind of a Hokage but the chakra coils of a child. If he tried a Rasenshuriken, his arm would explode.

Sasuke: Had the reaction time of an EMS user but the muscle density of a twig. If he tried to move at lightning speed, his tendons would snap.

Sakura: Had the knowledge of the world's greatest medic but the chakra reserves of a civilian. She could diagnose anything but couldn't cure a paper cut without passing out.

The Solution: The Grind

Kakashi sat on a rock, watching them. He wasn't reading. He was taking notes.
"Alright," Kakashi called out. "Lap 50. Handstand walk. No chakra enhancement."

"You're a demon, Sensei," Naruto grunted, sweat pouring down his face as he walked on his hands.

"I'm just the supervisor," Kakashi pointed a thumb at the trees. "Talk to your coaches."

From the branches, The Ageless Three (Boruto, Sarada, Himawari) were shouting instructions.

Boruto: "Keep your core tight, Dad! You're wobbling! The Seventh Hokage doesn't wobble!"
Sarada: "Papa, your left elbow is flaring out during the push-up! Do you want to tear a ligament?"
Himawari: "Sakura-neechan! Focus your chakra into your fingertips! Don't break the rock, just crack it!"

Montage: Month 1-2 (Physical Conditioning)

They abandoned Jutsu. They focused purely on the vessel.

Diet: Akimichi calorie pills (stolen by Choji) mixed with medicinal herbs (stolen by Sakura).

Weights: Lee's leg weights were introduced early. Naruto wore them while sleeping.

Speed: They played tag with Boruto. Boruto used his Karma (Stage 1) to cheat.

Result: They weren't growing taller fast enough, but they were getting dense. Their movements lost the jerky quality of childhood and gained the fluidity of veterans.

Montage: Month 3-4 (The Hyuga Intervention)

The Hyuga Compound. Main Dojo.

Neji Hyuga (Age 9) was training. His rotation was perfect. His anger was palpable.
He sensed someone behind him.
"Go away, Hinata-sama."

Hinata (Age 8) stood in the doorway. She wasn't hiding. She was wearing a simple training gi.
"Neji-niisan," she said softly. "Spar with me."

Neji turned, his Byakugan active. "Spar? With you? You're weak. You're kind. Kindness is a weakness in the Hyuga clan."

"Is it?" Hinata stepped onto the mat. She assumed the Gentle Fist stance.

Neji scoffed. He lunged. 8 Trigrams: Sixty-Four Palms.
He was fast. A prodigy.
But Hinata... didn't move.
She waited until the last possible millisecond.

Step. Slap. Step. Poke.

She parried Neji’s strikes with minimum effort. She wasn't using force; she was redirecting his momentum. It was the movement of a master who had fought moon aliens.

Neji’s eyes widened. "How..."

He aimed a strike at her heart.
Hinata caught his wrist. She didn't crush it. She held it firmly.

"Destiny isn't a cage, Neji," Hinata said, her voice firm, channeling her future self. "You are not a bird in a cage. You are just... angry. And that's okay."

She released him. She tapped his forehead—right on the Caged Bird Seal.
"One day, my husband will change this clan," she whispered. "But until then... I'll protect you."

Neji stood there, stunned. For the first time, the "failure" looked like a giant.
From the roof, Hiashi Hyuga watched, his tea cup trembling. When did my daughter become... terrifying?

Montage: Month 5-6 (Jutsu Refinement)

The Waterfall.

Sasuke stood on the water. He held a Chidori in his hand.
"I can't maintain the output," he hissed. "My arm is burning."

"Refine the shape," Sarada instructed, activating her Sharingan. "Don't just blast it. Compress it. Make it a needle, not a hammer."

Sasuke focused. The chirping noise quieted down to a hum. The blue lightning turned white-hot.
Chidori Senbon.
He fired a needle of electricity. It pierced a rock 50 meters away.
"Better," Sasuke smirked.

Naruto was meditating. He was trying to enter Sage Mode.
"Nope," Naruto opened his eyes. "Body can't handle nature energy yet. I'll turn into a stone frog."

"Stick to the basics, Dad," Boruto said, tossing him a scroll. "Flying Thunder God (Hiraishin). Grandpa's technique."

Naruto caught the scroll. "I can't teleport yet. My chakra signature is too small."

"Don't teleport yourself," Boruto grinned. "Teleport your kunai. Use the formula to redirect weapons. It uses 1% of the chakra."

Naruto’s eyes lit up. "Defensive Hiraishin... genius!"

The Finish Line: Six Months Later

The Gates of Konoha. Present Day.

The Chunin Exams were one week away.
Teams from other villages were arriving.

Three figures walked through the gates. They wore sand-colored cloaks.
Gaara, Kankuro, and Temari.

Kankuro bumped into a small boy with a long scarf running out of a shop (Konohamaru).
"Watch it, brat," Kankuro snarled, grabbing Konohamaru by the collar.

"Put him down," a voice said from the tree above.

Kankuro looked up.
Sasuke Uchiha sat on the branch. He was tossing a rock up and down.
His aura was different. It was sharp.

"And who are you?" Kankuro asked.

"Someone who hates bullies," Sasuke said. He crushed the rock in his hand. Dust fell.

Gaara looked up. His eyes met Sasuke’s.
Usually, Gaara would see fear.
Today, he saw... pity?

"Mother..." Gaara whispered, clutching his head. "He... wants to feed you?"

"Wrong," a second voice said.
Naruto appeared next to Gaara. He didn't use speed; he used a Body Flicker so quiet it didn't disturb the wind.
"We don't want to fight," Naruto smiled, placing a hand on Gaara’s gourd.

The sand reacted instantly, rising to defend Gaara.
But Naruto didn't flinch. He just patted the sand.
"Calm down, Shukaku," Naruto whispered. "You're cranky today."

The sand... stopped.
Gaara froze. He spoke to the beast?

"Let's go," Temari said nervously, sensing the danger level of these 'Genin'. "We're here for the exams, not a fight."

Kankuro dropped Konohamaru. The Sand Siblings walked away quickly.
"Those guys," Kankuro whispered. "They're monsters."

The Reunion

As the Sand team left, Sakura walked up to her boys.
"Did you have to scare them?"

"We established dominance," Sasuke said. "It saves time later."

"Besides," Naruto grinned, looking at the village filling up with ninja. "The party is just getting started."

Suddenly, a loud explosion rocked the village entrance.
A giant cloud of smoke.
Three massive toads appeared? No. A giant snake? No.

It was Jiraiya, standing on a toad, striking a pose.
"I HAVE RETURNED! HIDE YOUR WOMEN!"

Naruto face-palmed. "Oh no. He's early."

"Actually," Kakashi appeared, reading his book. "He's right on time. The Examiners just posted the roster."

Kakashi held up a paper.
Chunin Exam Phase 1 starts in 3 Days.
Proctor: Ibiki Morino.

"Ibiki," Naruto chuckled. "I remember him. Scary face, soft heart."

"Focus," Sasuke said. "Orochimaru is definitely inside the village by now. He'll be wearing a face mask."

"Then let's go rip it off," Sakura cracked her knuckles.

Here is Chapter 15: The Written Exam (God Mode).

This chapter transforms the high-tension psychological thriller of the Written Exam into a comedic display of intellectual dominance.

Chapter 15: The Written Exam (God Mode)

Room 301. The Academy. 10:00 AM.

The room was packed. Candidates from every village glared at each other. The air was thick with tension, testosterone, and cheap cologne.

Team 7 sat in the middle row. They weren't glaring. They were bored.
Sasuke was cleaning his fingernails.
Sakura was mentally rearranging the seating chart to optimize airflow.
Naruto was asleep.

The Spy

A silver-haired boy with glasses approached them. Kabuto Yakushi.
"You guys look relaxed," Kabuto smiled, pulling out his ninja info cards. "But you should be careful. The others are tense. I have data on everyone here. Rock Lee. Gaara of the Sand. Would you like to see?"

In the original timeline, Team 7 was awed.
In this timeline, Sasuke didn't look up.
"Kabuto Yakushi," Sasuke said, his voice low enough that only Kabuto could hear. "Adopted son of Nonō Yakushi. Medical ninjutsu specialist. Root operative. Spy for Orochimaru. Currently suppressing your chakra to appear as a Genin level 3."

Kabuto froze. His smile twitched.
"That's... quite the imagination."

"Your cards are outdated," Sakura added, not looking at him. "And your acting is a C-minus. Tell Orochimaru we said hello."

Kabuto slowly backed away, sweating. Who are these kids?

The Proctor Enters

POOF.
A cloud of smoke exploded at the front of the room.
Ibiki Morino appeared, flanked by a dozen sentinels. His scarred face was the stuff of nightmares.

"I am Ibiki Morino, your proctor for the first exam," he barked. "From this moment on, you are my enemies."

He explained the rules:

Written test.

Point deduction system.

Get caught cheating 5 times, you fail.

If one team member fails, the whole team fails.

"Begin!"

The Test

The sound of pencils scratching against paper filled the room.
Most Genin were panicking. The questions were impossible. Cryptography, ballistics, advanced chakra theory. They were designed to force candidates to cheat.

Naruto Uzumaki picked up his pencil.
He looked at Question 1: Decipher this code based on the rotational cipher of the Cloud Village.

Naruto suppressed a laugh. I wrote this code during the Fourth Great Ninja War to coordinate the Allied Forces.
He began to write. He didn't just answer; he corrected the grammar in the question.

Sasuke Uchiha looked at Question 4: Calculate the trajectory of a shuriken in a crosswind of 15m/s.
Sasuke: "Boring."
He wrote down the answer, then added three alternative calculations accounting for lightning nature infusion and humidity.

Sakura Haruno looked at Question 9: Identify the chemical composition of this poison based on the symptoms.
She finished the test in three minutes. She spent the rest of the time drawing a detailed anatomical diagram of Ibiki’s scars on the back of her paper, diagnosing his chronic pain.

The Cheating Game

Around them, chaos was unfolding silently.
Shino used his bugs.
Kankuro used his puppet disguised as a proctor.
Neji used his Byakugan.
Ino Yamanaka prepared her Mind Transfer Jutsu. She aimed for Sakura.

Zwoop.

Ino found herself inside Sakura’s mind.
Usually, this was an empty space with an "Inner Sakura."
Today, Ino found herself standing in a massive, infinite library. A giant spectral version of Sakura (The Hundred Healings Seal Avatar) looked down at her.

Inner Sakura: "You're trespassing, Ino-pig. Read a book or get out."

Ino was kicked out of the jutsu instantly. She gasped, clutching her head.
"What... was that?"

Hinata's Offer

Naruto was sitting quietly.
Hinata Hyuga, sitting next to him, nudged his elbow.
"Naruto-kun," she whispered, uncovering her paper. "You... you can copy mine."

Naruto turned. He saw her terrified, kind eyes.
He remembered her jumping in front of Pain. He remembered their wedding.
He smiled, a genuine, soft smile that made Hinata’s heart stop.

"Thanks, Hinata," Naruto whispered back. "But I'm good. You focus on passing. You're going to be a great Chunin."

Hinata turned so red she almost emitted steam.

The Tenth Question

45 minutes passed. Ibiki slammed his hand on the desk.
"Pencils down!"

The room went silent.
"Now," Ibiki said, his sadism ramping up. "We move to the Tenth Question. But first... a choice."

He gave the ultimatum: Take the question, and if you get it wrong, you remain a Genin forever. Or, quit now and try again next year.

Hands started going up. People were leaving. The psychological pressure was crushing.

In the original timeline, Naruto slammed his hand down and yelled about his ninja way.
In this timeline, Naruto stood up slowly. He adjusted his jacket. The room went quiet. He walked to the front of the class.

"Sit down, kid," Ibiki growled. "Or are you quitting?"

Naruto hopped onto Ibiki’s desk. He looked at the proctor eye-to-eye.
"Ibiki-san," Naruto said. "You're trying to weed out the cowards. You want to see who has the guts to lead a mission when the odds are zero."

Naruto turned to the remaining students.
"A ninja doesn't quit because the rules say he might fail. A ninja changes the rules."

He looked back at Ibiki.
"We're staying. All of Team 7. And if I become a Genin for life... then I'll be the first Genin to become Hokage. You can put that in your report."

The room erupted. The fear vanished, replaced by the fire Naruto had just lit.
Ibiki stared at the boy. He saw the eyes of Minato Namikaze. He saw the grin of Kushina Uzumaki.

Ibiki laughed. A rare, genuine laugh.
"Well said. You pass."

"Huh?" The class blinked.

"The Tenth Question was the choice," Ibiki smirked. "Everyone remaining in this room... passes the first exam."

The Crash

Before the celebration could start, the window shattered.
CRASH.

A banner flew into the room, pinning itself to the ceiling: THE SEXY AND SINGLE MITARASHI ANKO!
Anko rolled in, striking a pose.
"Alright you maggots! No time to celebrate! I'm your proctor for the Second Exam! Follow me to the Forest of Death!"

She looked around. "Ibiki? You let this many pass? You're going soft."

Ibiki lit a cigarette. "We have a weird batch this year, Anko. Especially that one." He pointed at Naruto.

Naruto waved. "Hi, Anko-sensei! Still owe me for that dango I bought you in the fu— I mean, nice to meet you!"

Anko blinked. Did that brat just say he bought me dango?

Team 7 stood up.
"Phase 2," Sasuke said, adjusting his gloves. "The Forest of Death."

"Orochimaru's playground," Sakura cracked her neck.

"Let's go snake hunting," Naruto grinned.

End of Chapter 15

Status Update:

Written Exam: Passed with S-Rank distinction (unofficially).

Here is Chapter 16: The Forest of Death (Predator becomes Prey).

This chapter features the confrontation with Orochimaru. It highlights the desperate gap between "God-tier Skill" and "Genin-tier Hardware."

Chapter 16: The Forest of Death

Training Ground 44. Gate 12. 2:00 PM.

The fence loomed high, covered in warning signs.
Anko Mitarashi stood before the candidates, eating dango.
"This is the Forest of Death," she grinned, hoping to smell fear. "You'll be signing these consent forms first. If you die, it's not my paperwork."

She handed a form to Naruto.
Naruto signed it immediately without reading.
"Here you go, Anko-sensei. Can we go? I want to set a record."

Anko blinked. "You have a death wish, kid?"

"No," Sasuke said, checking the sharpness of his kunai. "We have a schedule."

Anko narrowed her eyes. Cocky brats. They'll be the first to die.
"Gate 12 open! BEGIN!"

The Entry

Team 7 blurred into the forest.
They didn't run on the ground. They moved through the canopy, skipping the rot and the giant leeches.

Five Minutes In.
A team of Rain Genin (Oboro’s team) merged from the bark of a tree, aiming for a blindside ambush.
"Die!"

Zip.
Sasuke didn't even look. He threw three shuriken attached to wires. The wires wrapped around the Rain ninja, tying them to the trunk.
Sakura dropped down, plucking the Heaven Scroll from their pouch.
"We needed an Earth scroll," Sakura sighed. "Useless."

Naruto poked the leader. "Do you guys have any snacks? No? Okay, bye."

Team 7 vanished, leaving the Rain team humiliated and tied up.
"What... just happened?"

The Wind

Sector 9. 3:00 PM.

The forest went silent. The insects stopped buzzing. The wind picked up, carrying the scent of rot and snakes.

Team 7 stopped.
They landed in a clearing. They formed a triangle formation instantly.

"He's here," Sasuke whispered. His hand shook—not from fear, but from the memory of the Curse Mark.

A woman from the Grass Village (Shiore) rose slowly from the ground, her tongue extending impossibly long to lick her cheek.
"My, my," the voice was raspy, vibrating with S-Rank chakra. "You possess... excellent eyes."

Orochimaru had arrived.

The Killing Intent

Orochimaru released his Killing Intent.
Usually, Genin would be paralyzed. They would see visions of their own death.

Sakura yawned. "Visual hallucination: decapitation. Grade B execution. You're losing your touch, Orochimaru."

Orochimaru paused. His eyes narrowed.
"You know me?"

"We know everything," Naruto stepped forward. He wasn't smiling. "And we know you're looking for a new vessel because your current one is rejecting you."

Orochimaru ripped off his face mask, revealing his pale, snake-like visage.
"Fascinating. Minato's brat has a sharp tongue. Let's see if your blood is just as sharp."

The Boss Fight (Nerfed)

Orochimaru lunged. He was fast—too fast for eight-year-old eyes to track comfortably.
But Team 7 didn't track with eyes; they tracked with prediction.

Step 1: The Trap
Orochimaru aimed for Sasuke.
Sasuke performed the Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
He channeled the fire along the wires he had set up seconds before.
WOOSH.
The flames engulfed Orochimaru.

"Too slow!" Orochimaru shed his skin, bursting out of the fire unharmed, diving for Sasuke's neck. "I will take you!"

Step 2: The Medic
Sakura was waiting. She didn't punch (she would break her hand). She threw a glass vial.
It shattered on Orochimaru’s path.
Purple Haze Distillate. (A diluted version of the poison she analyzed from the future).

Orochimaru inhaled. He coughed. His paralysis resistance kicked in, but for 0.5 seconds, he froze.
"Poison? A Genin made this?"

Step 3: The Hokage
Naruto was in the air.
He had two Shadow Clones throwing him downward.
"Uzumaki Sealing Art: Five Elements Suppression!"

Naruto slammed his five fingers into Orochimaru’s chest.
It wasn't strong enough to seal the Sannin's chakra, but it was enough to disrupt his flow.
Orochimaru’s chakra flared chaotically.

"You little..." Orochimaru’s neck stretched. He bypassed the defense. He opened his mouth, fangs dripping with the Curse Seal formula. He aimed for Sasuke's neck.

"SASUKE!" Naruto yelled.

Sasuke couldn't dodge. His body was at its limit.
But he didn't freeze.
He pulled a kunai. He didn't aim at Orochimaru.
He aimed at himself.

"Bite me," Sasuke hissed, eyes spinning with the Sharingan, "and I sever my own carotid artery. You want a vessel? You'll get a corpse."

Orochimaru stopped inches from Sasuke's neck.
The snake paused.
He looked at the boy. The sheer audacity. The resolve. It was... intoxicating.

"You would kill yourself to spite me?" Orochimaru licked his lips. "Magnificent. You truly are the perfect Uchiha."

The Bluff

Orochimaru retracted his neck. He stood tall, dusting off his kimono.
"You are weak," Orochimaru sneered. "Your bodies are pathetic. But your minds... you fight like veterans. It's unnatural."

"We're just built different," Naruto panted, his small knees shaking from the exertion.

"I will let you live," Orochimaru decided. He burned the Earth Scroll in his hand with blue flames. "Because I want to see how you grow. Sasuke-kun... you will come to me eventually. Power seeks power."

"I don't need your power," Sasuke spat. "I have my own."

"We shall see."
Orochimaru began to sink into the ground.
"Oh, and beware the Sand sibling. He is... unstable."

With a final sinister chuckle, the Sannin vanished.

The Aftermath

The moment Orochimaru left, Team 7 collapsed.
Sasuke fell to his knees, vomiting from the stress.
Naruto lay on his back, gasping for air.
Sakura leaned against a tree, her hands trembling uncontrollably.

"That..." Naruto wheezed. "...was too close."

"We can't beat him," Sasuke wiped his mouth. "Not yet. If he was serious, we'd be dead in ten seconds."

"He was playing," Sakura confirmed. "He barely used Ninjutsu. He just wanted to test Sasuke."

"We need the scroll," Naruto groaned, sitting up. "He burned ours."

The Easy Way

Just then, a giant snake burst from the bushes. It wasn't Orochimaru. It was a summon left behind to finish them off.
It opened its mouth to eat Naruto.

BAM.

A figure dropped from the sky.
Kabuto Yakushi landed on the snake's head, shattering its skull with a chakra scalpel.

"Wow!" Kabuto adjusted his glasses, feigning surprise. "You guys look beat! Need a hand?"

Team 7 looked at the spy.
They were exhausted. They were hurt.
They looked at each other.

"Kabuto-san," Naruto smiled—a fox-like, cunning smile. "You have an Earth scroll, right?"

Kabuto blinked. "Uh, actually, I—"

"Give it to us," Sasuke said, activating his Sharingan (one tomoe visible). "Or we tell Anko about the root cellar under the orphanage."

Kabuto froze. His smile vanished completely. His eyes went cold.
"You know too much."

"We're allies, remember?" Sakura smiled sweetly. "Just give us the scroll, Kabuto. Orochimaru wants us to pass, doesn't he? We can't pass without a scroll."

Kabuto stared at them for a long moment. He realized these children were terrifying.
He reached into his pouch and tossed an Earth scroll to Naruto.
"Good luck," Kabuto whispered menacingly. "You'll need it."

He shunshined away.

The Tower

Day 2. Noon.

Team 7 arrived at the central tower in record time.
They opened the scrolls.
Iruka Umino popped out in a puff of smoke.

"Congratulations! You passed the second ex—"
Iruka stopped. He looked at Team 7. They were covered in soot, snake slime, and exhaustion.
"Are you guys okay?"

"We're fine, Iruka-sensei," Naruto hugged him. "Just... tired. Really tired."

"We need ramen," Sasuke mumbled.

"And a shower," Sakura added.

Iruka smiled. "Well, you're the first team to arrive. You have three days to rest before the Preliminaries."

Orochimaru Encounter: Survived. No Curse Mark applied (Sasuke's suicide bluff worked).

Here is Chapter 17: The Waiting Room.

This chapter bridges the gap between the forest survival and the tournament. It focuses on the physical toll of the time-travel constraint and the psychological warfare within the Tower.

Chapter 17: The Waiting Room

The Central Tower. Private Quarters. Day 1, 3:00 PM.

The room was sparse: three cots, a scroll of "Heaven" and "Earth" mounted on the wall, and a single window overlooking the lethal forest they had just escaped.

Team 7 didn't celebrate. They collapsed.

Naruto lay face-down on the floor, his limbs sprawled like a starfish.
Sasuke sat against the wall, eyes closed, breathing in a slow, meditative rhythm.
Sakura was the only one moving, her hands glowing green with medical chakra as she inspected Sasuke’s neck.

"There's no mark," Sakura whispered, relief washing over her. "He didn't bite you."

"He wanted to," Sasuke murmured, not opening his eyes. "But he respects insanity. Threatening to slit my own throat... it bought us time."

"Your chakra coils are inflamed," Sakura diagnosed, moving to Naruto. "Both of you. You forced too much chakra through undeveloped pathways. If we had fought for one more minute, Naruto's heart might have gone into arrhythmia."

Naruto groaned into the floorboards. "Being small sucks. I used to be able to spam a thousand clones. Now I make five and I need a nap."

"We have three days," Sasuke said, finally opening his eyes. They were dark, serious. "We sleep. We eat. We let the muscles repair. No training. Just recovery."

Day 2: The Gathering Storm

The Tower Mess Hall. Noon.

By the second day, other teams began to trickle in.
The mess hall was a nervous wreck of exhausted Genin. Some were bleeding, some were crying, some were just staring at their food.

Team 7 sat at a corner table. They were eating with the discipline of soldiers—high protein, rapid consumption, minimal talking.

The Sand Siblings entered.
The room temperature seemed to drop. Gaara walked in, covered in sand, holding a corked gourd. He hadn't slept. He never slept.

He stopped at Team 7's table.
Kankuro and Temari tensed up behind him.

"You," Gaara said, his voice flat. He looked at Sasuke. "Your eyes. They are like mine."

Sasuke put down his chopsticks. He looked up.
In the past, Sasuke was terrified of Gaara.
Now, he saw a traumatized child who was being eaten alive by a Tanuki.

"No," Sasuke said calmly. "My eyes see the truth. Yours only see blood. Get some sleep, Gaara. It helps with the voices."

Gaara’s sand twitched. It surged forward—a threatening spike.
Clink.

Naruto didn't move, but his chopsticks pinned a fly to the table, inches from the sand spike.
"We're eating," Naruto said, his voice cheerful but his blue eyes hard as steel. "Don't get sand in my ramen."

Gaara stared at Naruto. The Shukaku inside him screamed: DANGER. PREDATOR. KILL.
Gaara clutched his head and walked away. "Mother... is confused."

The Youth

"SASUKE UCHIHA!"
Rock Lee (Team Guy) burst into the room, followed by Tenten and Neji.
"I challenge you! Here! Now! The power of Youth cannot be contained!"

Sasuke sighed. He rubbed his temples.
"Lee. Sit down."

"I will not!" Lee struck a pose. "I want to prove that hard work beats genius!"

"You're fast," Sasuke said, cutting him off. "You have weights on your legs. You can open five of the Eight Inner Gates. Your primary lotus puts a massive strain on your body. If we fight now, we both get injured before the prelims. Save it for the finals."

Lee froze. "How... how do you know about the Gates?"

"I know a guy," Sasuke said vaguely (thinking of Might Guy in a wheelchair). "Now, eat your curry."

Neji narrowed his eyes. The Uchiha... he analyzed Lee instantly.

Day 3: The Spy and the Plan

The Hallway. Midnight.

The tower was quiet.
Kabuto Yakushi was leaning against a wall, adjusting his glasses. He was watching the roster of surviving teams.

"Looking for something, Four-Eyes?"

Kabuto turned. Sakura was standing there. She wasn't wearing her headband. She looked like a harmless little girl in pajamas.

"Just checking the competition," Kabuto smiled, his 'helpful senior' mask firmly in place. "You guys were impressive in the forest. I was worried."

"Cut the act," Sakura walked past him to get a cup of water. "We know you're gathering data for the prelims. You're going to drop out before the fights start, right? To preserve your cover?"

Kabuto’s smile didn't waver, but his eyes went cold.
"That would be the smart move. But maybe... maybe I want to see how strong you really are."

Sakura stopped. She looked back at him.
"Here's a medical tip, Kabuto. The stress of living a triple life causes premature aging. You should pick a side before you forget who you actually are."

She walked away, leaving him in the dark.
Kabuto touched his face. Forget who I am...
For a second, the spy felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature.

The Strategy Session

Back in the room, Team 7 held a final council.

Naruto: "Okay. Preliminaries are tomorrow. 1-on-1 fights. No holding back?"

Sasuke: "We have to hold back some things. If I use Kirin or Susanoo (even if I could), the village elders will throw me in a cage. We stick to Chunin-level techniques, executed with Kage-level timing."

Sakura: "I'm fighting Ino, probably. Unless the bracket changes."

Naruto: "Don't break her spirit, Sakura-chan. Just... gently tap her out."

Sasuke: "And if we fight Orochimaru's plant... Yoroi or Zaku?"

Naruto: "We destroy them. They're sound ninja. Annoying."

The Door Opens

The intercom crackled to life.
"All candidates, report to the arena. The Preliminaries will begin in 30 minutes."

Sasuke stood up. He cracked his neck. The fatigue was gone. The muscle memory was locked in.
"Time to go back to school."

Naruto grinned, tying his headband tight.
"Let's show them what real ninjas look like."

End of Chapter 17

Status Update:

Physical State: Recovered (85%).

Mental State: Focused.

Rivals:

Gaara: Confused/Wary.

Here is Chapter 18: The Preliminaries (Team 7 Unleashed).

This chapter showcases the terrifying gap between "Talented Genin" and "War Veterans," even when those veterans are running on low-battery hardware.

Chapter 18: The Preliminaries

The Tower Arena. 2:00 PM.

The surviving teams stood on the balcony.
Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi stood at the front, flanked by Jonin instructors.
Hayate Gekko (the proctor) coughed into his hand. "First match... names on the board."

The electronic board flickered.
Sasuke Uchiha vs. Yoroi Akado

Yoroi, a Sound spy in disguise, smirked beneath his veil. He looks exhausted. I’ll drain his chakra dry.
Sasuke didn't smirk. He walked down the stairs, hands in his pockets.

"Begin!"

Match 1: The Surgeon vs. The Leech

Yoroi lunged immediately, his hand glowing with chakra absorption energy. "I'll take everything you have!"

In the original timeline, Sasuke was crippled by the Curse Mark and had to rely on a desperate Lion's Barrage.
In this timeline, Sasuke watched Yoroi move in slow motion.

Sasuke’s Inner Monologue: "Sloppy footwork. Center of gravity too high. Telegraphed right hand."

Sasuke didn't dodge. He waited.
Just as Yoroi’s palm was inches from his chest, Sasuke grabbed Yoroi’s wrist.

"You want my chakra?" Sasuke whispered. "Take it."

Sasuke didn't use the Curse Mark. He channeled Fire Style chakra directly into his skin—not releasing it as a fireball, but superheating his own body temperature like a stove.
It was a variation of the Body Flicker he developed in his wanderings.

SIZZLE.

"GAAAH!" Yoroi screamed, recoiling. His hand was burned. "You... you're boiling!"

Sasuke stepped in. He swept Yoroi’s leg.
As Yoroi fell, Sasuke grabbed his collar.
"Lion's Combo? No. Too flashy."

Sasuke spun Yoroi mid-air, positioned himself behind him, and drove a single, precise elbow into Yoroi’s solar plexus.
CRACK.

Yoroi hit the ground. He didn't bounce. He stayed down, gasping for air that wouldn't come.

"Winner: Sasuke Uchiha," Hayate announced, surprised by the brutality.

The Gallery Reaction:
Kakashi raised an eyebrow. "Minimal movement. Maximum efficiency."
Might Guy frowned. "He didn't use any Ninjutsu? Just... pure Taijutsu fundamentals?"
Orochimaru (disguised as a Jonin) licked his lips. He didn't even use the Sharingan.

Match 4: Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka

"Begin!"

Sakura stood in the center of the arena.
Ino assumed her fighting stance. "I won't go easy on you just because you're my friend, Bill-board Brow!"

Ino charged. She threw a punch.
Sakura didn't block. She swayed to the left.
Ino threw a kick.
Sakura swayed to the right.

"Ino," Sakura said calmly, not even raising her fists. "Your stance is open. You're over-committing."

"Shut up!" Ino cut a lock of her hair, preparing the Mind Transfer trap. "Take this!"

She threw her hair on the ground to immobilize Sakura, then aimed her hands. "Ninja Art: Mind Transfer—"

Fwip.

Sakura was gone.
She was standing behind Ino.
She tapped a finger against Ino’s neck. A precise pressure point strike.

"If I were an enemy," Sakura whispered into Ino's ear, "you would be paralyzed from the neck down right now."

Ino froze. She felt the killing intent—cold, clinical, and overwhelming.
She dropped her hands.

"But I'm not an enemy," Sakura said softly. She swept Ino’s legs out from under her, catching her before she hit the ground, and laid her gently on the floor.
"Yield, Ino. You're not ready for the finals."

Ino looked up at Sakura. She saw strength she didn't recognize.
"I... I yield."

Winner: Sakura Haruno.

The Gallery Reaction:
Asuma (Ino’s Sensei) lit a cigarette, shaking his head. "She dismantled the Yamanaka formation in ten seconds. Who taught her that?"
Kurenai looked at Kakashi. "Did you?"
Kakashi shrugged. "She reads a lot."

Match 7: Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka

Kiba laughed as he jumped down. "Looks like I got the easy draw! Sorry, Naruto, but Akamaru and I are gonna wreck you!"

Akamaru barked.
Naruto smiled. He knelt down and held out his hand.
"Hey, boy. Who's a good boy?"

Akamaru stopped growling. He walked over to Naruto, sniffed his hand (smelling Kurama, the King of Beasts), and immediately rolled over for belly rubs.

"What the hell?!" Kiba yelled. "Akamaru! Traitor!"

Kiba popped a soldier pill. His skin turned red. He went feral.
"Beast Mimicry: Fang Over Fang!"

Kiba spun like a drill, aiming for Naruto.
In the original timeline, Naruto panicked.
In this timeline, Naruto sighed.

Naruto’s Inner Monologue: "Rotation speed is Mach 0.1. Trajectory is linear. I don't even need Sage Mode."

Naruto waited.
As the drill came close, Naruto side-stepped. He stuck out his foot.
Not a kick. Just a trip.

Wham.

Kiba’s momentum sent him crashing face-first into the wall.
He rebounded, dazed. "Lucky shot! Again!"

Kiba charged again.
Naruto stepped into Kiba's guard.
"Uzumaki Style: 2,000 Barrage!"

"Two thousand?!" The crowd gasped.

Naruto threw... one punch.
It was a straight right to the jaw. Perfect form. Hip rotation. Weight transfer.
POW.

Kiba spun in the air and hit the ground, unconscious.

"I rounded up," Naruto muttered, picking up Akamaru and handing him to the medic.

Winner: Naruto Uzumaki.

The Gallery Reaction:
Hinata smiled, pressing her fingers together. "Naruto-kun is... amazing."
Neji scowled. "He saw the rotation. He timed it perfectly. A fluke?"
Hiruzen (The Hokage) puffed his pipe. That was the Gentle Fist style... applied to a brawler's punch. Minato... you have a monster.

The Cliffhanger Match

The board flickered again.
Rock Lee vs. Gaara

Team 7 returned to the balcony. They didn't celebrate. They watched.
They knew what was coming.

"This is it," Sasuke said, leaning on the railing. "The fight that changes Lee's life."

"Should we intervene?" Sakura asked, worrying about Lee's injuries.

"No," Naruto said, his eyes solemn. "Lee needs to prove his ninja way. If we stop him, we insult him. But..."
Naruto looked at the medical team on standby.
"...Sakura-chan, be ready to jump in the second it's over. Don't let his bones shatter completely."

Down in the arena, Lee dropped his weights.
BOOM.
The ground shook.
Gaara’s sand rose.

The legendary beatdown was about to begin. But this time, the best medic in history was watching from the cheap seats, already calculating the surgery.

End of Chapter 18

Status Update:

Team 7: 3-0 Record. Zero injuries. Minimal chakra expenditure.

Reputation: The other Jonin are terrified/confused.

Chapter 19: The Surgeon and the Sage

Konoha General Hospital. OR 3. 8:00 AM.

The prognosis was grim. Rock Lee lay sedated on the table. His left arm and leg were crushed. Bone fragments were lodged in the nerves.
The Head Surgeon, a veteran medic named Dr. Amano, shook his head.
"It's impossible. The damage to the chakra network is extensive. If we operate, he has a 50% chance of survival, but he'll never be a ninja again."

"Move."

A small hand pushed Dr. Amano aside.
Sakura Haruno (Age 8) stood on a stool to reach the operating table. She was scrubbing up.
"Sakura?" Dr. Amano blinked. "You're a Genin. Get out."

"I am the apprentice of the Fifth Hokage (in spirit)," Sakura snapped, snapping latex gloves on. "And I am telling you that your diagnosis is lazy. The bone fragments can be extracted using a microscopic chakra scalpel technique. We don't need to fuse the spine; we need to regenerate the cartilage."

She looked at the nurse.
"Scalpel. Level 3 Chakra flow. Now."

The room froze. The killing intent radiating from this eight-year-old girl was sharper than the steel she held.
Dr. Amano stepped back, terrified. "L-Let her work."

The Procedure
Sakura worked for six hours.
She didn't just repair Lee; she upgraded him. She stimulated his cells to handle the stress of the Gates better in the future.
Inner Sakura: "I'm not letting you retire, Bushy Brow. You have a Youth to live."

When she finished, she peeled off the bloody gloves.
"He'll walk in a week," Sakura told the stunned staff. "He'll train in two. Tell Guy-sensei to cut his training volume by 20% for the first month or I'll break his other leg."

The Hot Springs. 10:00 AM.

Naruto Uzumaki walked into the women's bath area (the entrance, not the bath itself). He knew exactly who would be there.

Sure enough, a white-haired man was giggling, peeking through a hole in the fence.
Jiraiya. The Toad Sage.

In the original timeline, Naruto had to annoy him into training him.
In this timeline, Naruto walked up to him and kicked him in the shin.

"Ouch!" Jiraiya hopped on one foot. "What's the big idea, brat?!"

Naruto looked at him.
He saw the man who bought him his first popsicle. The man who taught him the Rasengan. The man who died believing he had failed.

Naruto didn't yell. He hugged him.
He hugged Jiraiya’s leg, burying his face in the fabric of his pants.

"Whoa," Jiraiya froze. "Kid? You okay? I didn't peek that hard."

"You're alive," Naruto whispered, his voice thick. "You old pervert. You're actually alive."

Jiraiya looked down. He saw the whiskered cheeks. He saw Minato's hair. But he felt a sorrow that was decades old.
"You know who I am?" Jiraiya asked softly.

Naruto wiped his eyes and looked up, grinning.
"Yeah. You're the guy who's going to teach me how to summon a toad that doesn't try to eat me. And then we're going to eat popsicles."

Jiraiya grinned back. "Cheeky brat. Fine. But you're paying for the popsicles."

The Mental Landscape

Later that afternoon, Boruto sat on top of the Hokage Monument. He was meditating.

Inner World:
Momoshiki Otsutsuki sat on a floating rock, looking bored.
"So," Momoshiki drawled. "You saved the green beast. You reunited the loud blonde with the pervert. Are we done playing house?"

"We're preparing," Boruto replied in the mind-space. "The invasion happens in one month. Orochimaru, the Sand, and the Sound."

"Orochimaru is a snake," Momoshiki scoffed. "He seeks immortality because he fears death. He is pathetic. But... that Gaara boy. He has a Tailed Beast that is... noisy."

"Shukaku," Boruto nodded.

"Yes. If he transforms in the village, it will be annoying," Momoshiki leaned forward. "Do you want me to handle it? I can absorb his Tailed Beast Bomb and fire it back at him. It would be... poetic."

"No," Boruto said firmly. "We don't nuke the village, Momoshiki. We save it. Besides, Dad wants to talk to him."

Momoshiki rolled his eyes. "Of course. 'Talk'. You humans and your inefficient vocal cords."

The Training Ground. Twilight.

Sasuke and Kakashi stood in a rocky ravine.
"Chidori," Kakashi said. "You know the signs. Ox, Rabbit, Monkey..."

"I know," Sasuke interrupted.
He performed the signs in a blur. Lightning chirped in his hand.
But instead of running, Sasuke stood still. The lightning changed color—from blue to a dark, violent purple.

"Purple Lightning?" Kakashi’s eye widened. "I haven't even invented that yet. That's my post-war technique."

"I saw you use it," Sasuke lied (he had seen Kakashi use it as Hokage). "It's better. No tunnel vision. No need for the Sharingan to aim."

"You're a scary kid, Sasuke," Kakashi sighed, pulling down his headband. "Fine. If you know Purple Lightning, then we focus on capacity. You have the skill of a Kage and the gas tank of a moped. Run up that cliff. Now."

The Hyuga Dojo. Night.

Hinata Hyuga (Awakened) stood in the center of the dojo.
Across from her was Hanabi (Age 3, watching) and Hiashi (Clan Head).

"Father," Hinata said, her voice clear and strong. "I wish to petition for the removal of the Caged Bird Seal from the Branch family."

Hiashi stared at her. "Hinata... you are the heiress. That seal protects our secrets."

"That seal creates hatred," Hinata said. "Neji hates us. And he is right to hate us."

She stepped forward. Her Byakugan activated—it was pure, white, and potent.
"If you won't change the clan," Hinata said, slipping into a Gentle Step stance that Hiashi had never seen (Hamura's lineage style), "then I will beat the tradition out of you. Spar with me, Father."

Hiashi stood up, outraged. "You are eight years old!"

Ten minutes later.
Hiashi was sitting on the floor, panting. He hadn't been hit, but he had been outmaneuvered at every turn. His daughter moved like water.

"We will... discuss this," Hiashi wheezed, looking at Hinata with a mix of shock and newfound respect.

Status Update:

Lee: Saved. Will recover in time for the invasion (but not the exams).

Jiraiya: Recruited as Naruto's mentor (again).

Momoshiki: Bored but cooperative.

Hinata: Starting a revolution in the Hyuga compound.

Ready for Chapter 20: The Finals Begin (Naruto vs. Neji)?

Not yet but the next chapter is the stadium that we have more audience then just the canon. There are Uchihas and Sasuke's family, Naruto's family, there is the fourth other than the third hokage, hyuga family including neji's father, and our main characters.

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 20: The Grand Stage (A Family Affair).

This chapter sets the scene for the Finals. In the original timeline, this event was shadowed by impending doom and personal loneliness. In this timeline, it is a vibrant, loud, and overwhelming celebration of life—which makes the stakes even higher for the time travelers who know what threatens it.

Chapter 20: The Grand Stage (A Family Affair)

The Konoha Stadium. 11:00 AM.

The roar was deafening.
It wasn't just a tournament; it was a festival. With the Uchiha Clan alive and the Fourth Hokage in power, Konoha was at its economic and cultural peak. The stadium, usually a grim concrete bowl, was draped in red and white banners. Vendors sold "Uzumaki Ramen" cups and "Uchiha Fireball" spicy dango.

The VIP Box (The Kage Summit)

At the highest point of the stadium sat the leaders.
Hiruzen Sarutobi (The Third Hokage) sat in his advisor chair, smoking his pipe contentedly.
Minato Namikaze (The Fourth Hokage) sat in the center. He wore the white haori with "Fourth Fire Shadow" emblazoned on the back. He looked young, sharp, and dangerously observant.

"Quite the turnout, Lord Hokage," a raspy voice came from the third chair.
The Kazekage (Orochimaru in disguise) adjusted his veil. "Konoha is... lively."

"Peace brings prosperity, Kazekage-dono," Minato smiled, his blue eyes scanning the Kazekage’s face. Minato didn't trust him. He sensed a coldness in the man's chakra—a slick, predatory intent. This isn't the Rasa I know, Minato thought. I'll have the ANBU double the perimeter.

The Audience: The Uchiha Sector

To the left of the main box, an entire section was filled with fans bearing the Uchiwa fan crest.
Fugaku Uchiha sat with his arms crossed, his face stern but his eyes attentive. He wore the full ceremonial garb of the Police Force Chief.
Mikoto Uchiha sat beside him, waving a small flag that said 'Go Sasuke-kun!'
Itachi Uchiha (off-duty) sat next to his mother. He was eating dango, looking completely relaxed. He wasn't a rogue ninja; he was just a proud big brother.

"Do you think Sasuke is ready?" Mikoto asked.
"He's more than ready," Itachi said, smiling. "He's evolved. He doesn't fight like a child anymore. He fights like... well, like me."

Fugaku huffed. "He better not use that wire trick again. Real Uchiha use Fire Style."
"Dear," Mikoto chided. "Let him be creative."

The Audience: The Uzumaki Sector

To the right, the noise was significantly louder.
Kushina Uzumaki was standing on her seat.
"THAT'S MY SON! THE BLONDE ONE! THE HANDSOME ONE! IF YOU TOUCH HIM I'LL PULVERIZE YOU!"

Himawari (disguised with a simple transformation jutsu to look like a random cousin) pulled on Kushina's sleeve. "Grandma... I mean, Auntie Kushina... sit down. People are staring."

"Let them stare!" Kushina laughed, her red hair floating menacingly behind her (the Red Hot Habanero mode was active). "Minato! Look! Our baby is down there!"

From the VIP box, Minato waved a small hand discreetly, terrified of his wife's volume.

The Audience: The Hyuga Sector

In the center, the atmosphere was rigid.
Hiashi Hyuga (Clan Head) sat with perfect posture.
Next to him sat a man who should have been dead in the original timeline: Hizashi Hyuga.
In this world, the "Cloud Village Incident" had been resolved by Minato's diplomacy (and a very threatening teleportation demonstration), sparing Hizashi's life.

Neji stood in the arena below, looking up. He didn't see a martyr. He saw his living father.
But the tension remained.
"Neji looks strong," Hizashi said quietly. "But his heart is heavy. He still believes the Branch family is lesser."

"He is a genius," Hiashi admitted. "Perhaps... the old ways are stifling him."
Hanabi (Age 3) was bouncing on Hiashi's knee. "Go Neji-nii!"

The Arena Floor

The finalists stood in a line.
Naruto, Sasuke, Neji, Gaara, Shino, Temari, Kankuro, Shikamaru.

Naruto looked up at the stands.
His eyes watered.
In his memory, this arena was where he fought Neji to prove he wasn't a failure to a village that hated him. He had looked up and seen empty seats where his parents should have been.
Now, he saw Kushina screaming his name. He saw Minato nodding with pride. He saw Himawari winking.

"Don't cry, dobe," Sasuke whispered, bumping Naruto's shoulder. "You'll ruin your tough guy image."

"Shut up, teme," Naruto sniffled, wiping his nose. "I just got some dust in my eye."

Sasuke looked at the Uchiha section. He saw Itachi. He saw his father.
He clenched his fist. I won't let Orochimaru touch this. I won't let anyone destroy this.

Genma Shiranui (The Proctor, chewing his senbon) stepped forward.
"Alright, listen up. You're the main event. The village is watching. The world is watching. Don't die."

He looked at the bracket.
"First Match: Naruto Uzumaki vs. Neji Hyuga."

The other competitors cleared the arena.
Naruto and Neji stood facing each other.

The Clash of Ideologies (Remixed)

Neji activated his Byakugan. Veins bulged around his eyes.
"Naruto," Neji said. "I have heard the rumors. They say you are the Hokage's son, but you have no talent for complex Jutsu. You rely on shadow clones and brute force."

"Is that what they say?" Naruto stretched his arms behind his head.

"Destiny is fixed," Neji declared, glancing at his father in the stands. "Even with my father alive, the distinction between Main and Branch remains. I am marked by the Caged Bird. You are marked by privilege. You cannot defeat a genius."

In the stands, Hizashi frowned. "He is still trapped in his own mind."
Hinata (sitting near the front) whispered, "Show him, Naruto-kun. Break the cage."

Naruto stopped stretching. He dropped his hands. His posture shifted from 'goofy kid' to 'war veteran'.
"Neji," Naruto said calmly. "You think you're trapped because of a seal on your forehead? I had a demon fox sealed in my gut the day I was born. I was hated for something I didn't choose."

Naruto pointed a thumb at the VIP box.
"My Dad is the Hokage. Do you know how much pressure that is? Everyone expects me to be a genius. But I'm not Minato Namikaze."

Naruto assumed a stance. It wasn't the clumsy brawler stance of his childhood. It was a balanced, grounded stance—a variation of the Frog Kumite.

"I'm Naruto Uzumaki," he grinned. "And I'm going to punch that fatalism right out of your face. Judge me by my blood? Nah. Judge me by this."

Naruto held up a single finger.
"One hit. That's all I need."

The crowd went silent.
Kushina stopped screaming.
Minato leaned forward.
Hiashi narrowed his eyes.

"Begin!" Genma shouted.

End of Chapter 20

Status Update:

Atmosphere: Electric.

Naruto's Motivation: Protecting the timeline where his parents are alive.

Neji's Motivation: Proving his worth to his living father/Fighting against the caste system.

Sasuke's Motivation: Defending his family from the looming invasion.

The Crowd: The ultimate audience.

Ready for Chapter 21: The Upper Hand (Naruto vs. Neji - The Remix)?

**User:**
You said

So we make Hinata not participate but instead focus to fix her family? If yes, I agree. Then, ready.

---

**Gemini:**
Yes, exactly. In this timeline, Hinata recognized that her battle wasn't in the exams—it was in the Hyuga compound. She withdrew from the competition to focus on dismantling the Main vs. Branch conflict from the inside, using her knowledge of the future and her newfound confidence. She is sitting with the Hyuga elders now, not as a shy girl, but as a political force.

Here is Chapter 21: The Upper Hand (Naruto vs. Neji - The Remix).

Chapter 21: The Upper Hand

The Arena Floor. The Stare Down.

The wind kicked up dust between the two fighters.
Neji Hyuga slipped into the opening stance of the Gentle Fist. His Byakugan veins pulsed, mapping every chakra point in Naruto’s body.
Naruto Uzumaki stood with his hands at his sides. No stance. No hand signs. Just a relaxed, terrifying stillness.

"You are arrogant," Neji stated, his eyes flicking toward the VIP box where his father, Hizashi, sat. "My father lives, yes. But he lives as a servant. The Caged Bird Seal still dictates his life. Just as destiny dictates that a failure like you cannot defeat a genius like me."

Naruto sighed. He scratched the back of his head.
"Man, you talk a lot. Are we fighting or debating philosophy?"

"We are doing both," Neji lunged.

The Exchange

Neji moved with blinding speed.
"Gentle Fist Art: Eight Trigrams Two Palms!"

Neji thrust his palm at Naruto’s chest.
Naruto didn't block. He shifted his weight three inches to the left.
Neji’s palm hit air.

"Four Palms!"
Naruto pivoted on his heel, letting Neji’s strike pass under his armpit.

"Eight Palms! Sixteen Palms!"
The attacks came in a flurry of precision strikes. To the audience, it looked like Naruto was being overwhelmed.
To the experts, it looked impossible.

In the VIP Box:
Minato narrowed his eyes. "He's not just dodging. He's sensing the intent before the muscle moves. That's..."
Jiraiya (standing in the shadows) grinned. "Senjutsu principles. He's not in Sage Mode, but he's using Frog Kata. He's using the nature energy around him to extend his sensory range."

In the Hyuga Section:
Hiashi watched, stunned. "Neji isn't landing a single hit. The boy... he is flowing like water."
Hinata sat calmly, sipping tea. "Naruto-kun isn't water, Father. He is the wind. You cannot strike the wind."

The Counter

Neji was getting frustrated. He had struck 32 times and hit nothing but orange jumpsuit fabric.
"Stop moving!" Neji roared.
"Eight Trigrams: Sixty-Four Palms!"

He accelerated. He cornered Naruto against the arena wall. There was nowhere to dodge.
"Two palms! Four! Eight! Sixteen! Thirty-Two!"

Neji’s strikes were a blur. He aimed the final blow—the Sixty-Fourth palm—directly at Naruto’s chakra network to shut him down completely.
"Sixty-Four! This is the end!"

THWACK.

The sound echoed through the stadium.
But it wasn't the sound of a body hitting the floor.
It was the sound of a hand catching a wrist.

The dust settled.
Naruto was standing there. He had caught Neji’s wrist mid-strike with one hand.
Naruto wasn't even breathing hard.

"Is that it?" Naruto asked, his voice devoid of mockery, just pure disappointment. "Is that the limit of the Hyuga destiny?"

Neji’s eyes widened. "Impossible... My rotation... my speed..."

"You're fighting with anger," Naruto said, gripping Neji’s wrist tighter. "You're looking at your dad in the stands and hating the seal on his head. So you're blind."

Naruto let go of Neji and stepped back.
"Come on. Use the Rotation. I want to show you something."

The One Hit

Neji, humiliated and furious, spun. Chakra poured out of his body.
"Rotation!"
A blue sphere of spinning chakra formed around him—the ultimate defense. It repelled physical attacks and ninjutsu alike.

"Perfect defense?" Naruto murmured. "There's no such thing."

Naruto pulled back his right fist.
He didn't charge up a Rasengan.
He didn't cloak himself in Kurama's chakra.
He focused purely on Frog Kata. He gathered the invisible natural energy around his fist—an extension of his physical reach that the Byakugan could not see.

"Sage Art: Frog Strike."

Naruto punched the air in front of the spinning sphere.
He didn't touch the chakra rotation.
But the force of the natural energy slammed into the sphere like a cannonball. It disrupted the flow. It shattered the centrifugal force.

CRASH.

The blue sphere shattered like glass.
The invisible shockwave continued through, hitting Neji squarely in the chest.

Neji flew backward. He tumbled across the dirt, crashing into the far wall.
He tried to stand up. He coughed. He couldn't move. His chakra points weren't blocked—his spirit was just broken.

The Lesson

Naruto walked over to Neji.
The crowd was silent. They had just watched a "failure" shatter the ultimate defense with a single punch.

Naruto knelt down.
"Neji. Look at the VIP box."

Neji struggled to look up.
He saw his father, Hizashi, standing at the railing. Hizashi wasn't looking at Hiashi. He wasn't looking at the floor. He was looking at Neji, tears streaming down his face, clapping his hands.

"Your dad isn't a slave today," Naruto whispered. "He's just a dad watching his son grow up. The only cage is the one you built in your head because you were too scared to hope."

Naruto stood up and offered a hand.
"Changes are coming, Neji. Hinata is working on the clan. I'm working on the village. But you gotta stop sulking and start helping."

Neji looked at the hand. The hand of the boy he called a failure.
Slowly, shaking, Neji took it.
Naruto pulled him up.

"Winner: Naruto Uzumaki!" Genma announced.

The Aftermath

The stadium erupted.
Kushina was crying. "THAT'S MY BOY! HE PUNCHED THE GHOST OUT OF HIM!"
Minato sat back, a massive smile on his face. "He's surpassed me. I never mastered Senjutsu that quickly."

Hizashi bowed deeply to Hiashi. "Brother... perhaps we have been wrong."
Hiashi looked at Hinata. "Perhaps... we have."

As Naruto walked back to the waiting area, he passed Gaara.
Gaara was trembling. The sand was leaking out of the gourd uncontrollably.
"He... he is strong," Gaara whispered, clutching his head. "Mother wants his blood. But... I am afraid."

Temari looked at her brother in horror. Gaara is afraid?

Sasuke met Naruto at the stairs.
"One hit?" Sasuke smirked. "Technically, you hit the air, not him."

"Details," Naruto grinned. "Did you see his face? Priceless."

"Focus," Sasuke’s expression hardened. "The invasion signal is coming. During the next match."

"Right," Naruto’s smile vanished. "Sasuke vs. Gaara. Don't kill him. We need him for the war later."

"I'll try," Sasuke adjusted his gloves. "But if he turns into a raccoon, I'm putting him down."

End of Chapter 21

Status Update:

Naruto: Defeated Neji (No diff). Revealed partial Sage abilities.

Neji: Defeated physically and ideologically. Redemption arc accelerated.

Hinata: Successfully influencing the Hyuga elders.

The Crowd: Hype levels critical.

The Threat: Gaara is unstable. The invasion countdown has begun.

Here is Chapter 22: The Invasion Begins (The Counter-Ambush).

This chapter details the pivotal moment where the timeline fractures violently. The "Konoha Crush" begins, but the defenders are playing with a marked deck.

Chapter 22: The Invasion Begins

The Arena Floor. 12:00 PM.

Sasuke Uchiha stood across from Gaara.
The contrast was stark. Sasuke was calm, his posture relaxed, his breathing steady. Gaara was twitching, clutching his left shoulder, muttering to the sand.

"Mother..." Gaara whispered, his eyes wide with insomnia and madness. "He... he wants to feed you. But his blood... it smells like... lightning."

Sasuke activated his Sharingan. Two tomoe spun into three—a detail only the keenest observers noticed.
"Gaara," Sasuke said, his voice cutting through the murmuring crowd. "Surrender. Or I'll have to wake you up."

"DIE!" Gaara screamed.

The Speed of Sound

The sand surged forward—a massive tsunami aimed at Sasuke.
In the original timeline, Sasuke had to run up the wall to gain speed.
In this timeline, Sasuke simply vanished.

Zip.

He reappeared inside Gaara’s guard.
CRACK.
A kick to the chin. Gaara flew upward.

Zip.
Sasuke appeared behind him in mid-air.
"Too slow."
A heel drop sent Gaara crashing into the dirt.

The crowd gasped.
Rock Lee (watching from the infirmary balcony on crutches) gripped the railing. "He... he is moving as fast as I did without weights! How?!"

Guy gave a thumbs up, though he was sweating. "It seems Kakashi has been busy."

The Shell

Gaara panicked. The absolute defense was failing. The sand couldn't keep up with Sasuke’s predictive movement.
"STAY AWAY!"
Gaara curled into a ball. The sand hardened around him, forming a sphere. The Shield of Shukaku.

Inside, Gaara began the transformation ritual. The Third Eye floated above, watching.

Sasuke landed softly. He looked at the sphere.
"Going into a cocoon?" Sasuke sighed. "Classic mistake. You just gave me a stationary target."

Sasuke walked to the arena wall. He began to channel chakra.
Sparks flew. The sound of a thousand birds chirping filled the stadium.
Chidori.

Sasuke held his wrist. The chakra was blue, focused, and lethal.
"I'm not aiming to kill," Sasuke muttered to himself. "Just to perform a little neurosurgery on the raccoon."

He charged.
The ground cracked under his sandals. He moved so fast the friction burned the air.

The Signal

High in the VIP box, the Kazekage (Orochimaru) watched.
"Now," he whispered.

He crushed a smoke bomb.
At the same moment, Kabuto (in the audience) performed a hand sign.
"Temple of Nirvana: Infinite Darkness!"

White feathers began to fall from the sky.
The audience’s eyes glazed over. Heads began to droop.

The Counter-Play

In the original timeline, the whole stadium fell asleep except for the Jonin.
In this timeline...

Sakura Haruno stood up in the stands. She slammed her hands together.
"KAI! (RELEASE!)"

She didn't just release it for herself. She channeled a massive burst of chakra through the stadium's floorboards, disrupting the genjutsu for everyone in her section (The Uchiha and Hyuga sectors).

"WAKE UP!" Sakura yelled. "INVASION!"

Fugaku Uchiha stood up instantly. "Uchiha Police Force! Secure the exits! Civilians to the shelters!"
Hiashi Hyuga activated his Byakugan. "Rotation! Deflect the debris!"

The Impact

Down in the arena, Sasuke ignored the feathers.
He thrust the Chidori into Gaara’s sand sphere.
CRUNCH.

He didn't stop at the skin. He pushed through, grabbed Gaara by the collar inside the shell, and discharged a secondary electric shock directly into Gaara’s nervous system.
"Sleep," Sasuke commanded.

The Shukaku transformation halted. Gaara screamed, the sand crumbling away as he fell unconscious, the possession disrupted by the lightning.

The Box: Kage vs. Kage

Smoke filled the VIP box.
Orochimaru (Kazekage) leaped at Hiruzen, kunai drawn, ready to hold a blade to his throat.

But the blade never reached the Third Hokage.
Because a yellow flash appeared in between them.

Minato Namikaze caught Orochimaru’s wrist.
Minato wasn't smiling. His eyes were cold—the eyes of the Yellow Flash during the Third War.

"Rasa," Minato said, his voice low. "Or should I say... Orochimaru?"

Orochimaru’s eyes widened. He moved before I could even blink?

"You're disrupting my son's graduation exam," Minato said.
He placed a hand on Orochimaru’s chest. A formula seal appeared instantly.
"Flying Thunder God: Level 2."

BAM.
A Rasengan slammed into Orochimaru’s stomach, sending the Sannin blasting through the roof of the stadium box and out into the open air.

"Hiruzen!" Minato shouted. "Secure the village! I'll handle the snake!"

The Summoning

Outside the walls, the giant snakes of the Sand Village appeared, crushing the outer perimeter.
But they were met by a roar.

"SUMMONING JUTSU!"

Jiraiya landed on the wall, summoning Gamahiro (The Giant Toad).
"Sorry I'm late!" Jiraiya yelled, striking a pose. "But the Toad Sage always arrives with style!"

Gamahiro drew his twin swords and decapitated the first snake instantly.

The Chaos

The Sound Four (Tayuya, Kidomaru, Sakon, Jirobo) landed on the roof of the stadium to erect the Four Violet Flames Formation.
They successfully created the barrier—but they trapped the wrong people inside.

Inside the barrier were:

Minato Namikaze

Hiruzen Sarutobi

Orochimaru (Recovering from the Rasengan)

Hashirama Senju (Reanimated - wait, what?)

Tobirama Senju (Reanimated)

Orochimaru wiped blood from his mouth. He summoned the coffins of the First and Second Hokage.
"You are fast, Minato," Orochimaru hissed. "But can you fight the legends of the past?"

Minato looked at the coffins opening.
He looked at Hiruzen.
"Lord Third," Minato said, pulling out a special kunai. "You take Lord Second. I'll take Lord First. Try not to die."

Hiruzen shed his robes, revealing his battle armor. "I haven't felt this alive in twenty years."

Team 7 Regroups

On the arena floor, chaos reigned. Sound and Sand ninja were pouring in.
Naruto and Sakura landed next to Sasuke, who was holding an unconscious Gaara.

"We got him," Sasuke said. "Invasion triggered. But we have the asset."

"Kankuro and Temari are coming," Naruto pointed. The siblings were rushing down to retrieve Gaara.

"Let them take him," Shikamaru said, jumping down (he had faked sleep but woke up when Sakura yelled). "If they take him away, the threat leaves the village."

"No," Naruto said. "If they take him, he wakes up and turns into a monster in the forest. We finish this here."

Naruto looked at Sasuke and Sakura.
"Formation B. Protect the civilians. I'm going to help Dad."

"You're not going into the barrier!" Sakura yelled. "That's Kage level!"

"I know," Naruto grinned, entering Sage Mode (imperfect, eyes turning yellow/orange). "Good thing I'm Kage level."

End of Chapter 22

Status Update:

Gaara: Neutralized (Unconscious).

Civilians: Evacuating efficiently thanks to Fugaku/Hiashi.

The Barrier: Active. Inside is a 2v3 (Minato/Hiruzen vs Orochimaru/Hashirama/Tobirama).

Team 7: Split. Naruto heading to the roof. Sasuke/Sakura defending the arena.

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 23: The Battle of the Kages (Minato Unleashed).

This chapter addresses the chaos outside the arena and the legendary battle inside the barrier, highlighting the secret intervention of the future grandchildren.

Chapter 23: The Battle of the Kages

Konoha Streets. Sector 4. 12:15 PM.

The invasion was in full swing. Giant snakes crushed buildings. Sound and Sand ninja swarmed the rooftops.
But they were running into unexpected resistance.

The Shadow Guardians (The Future Kids)

Boruto Uzumaki sat on a telephone pole, watching a giant three-headed snake loom over the evacuation shelter where the Academy students (including Konohamaru) were hiding.
"That snake is annoying," Boruto muttered. "Momoshiki?"

"Do not ask me to kill a reptile," Momoshiki sighed in his head. "Do it yourself."

Boruto jumped. He didn't weave signs. He extended his hand.
"Lightning Style: Purple Electricity!" (A technique he learned from Kakashi in the future).
He coated his sword in purple lightning and sliced the snake's head clean off in a single, blurring motion.
He landed in front of Iruka, who was guarding the students with a kunai.

"Who..." Iruka stared at the hooded boy.

"Just a passing wanderer," Boruto grinned, pulling his hood down further. "Get them to the shelters, Sensei. I'll clear the path."
Boruto vanished in a flash of speed that reminded Iruka painfully of the Fourth Hokage.

The Uchiha Sector

Sarada Uchiha was moving through the smoke. She found Mikoto Uchiha cornered by three Sound ninja.
"An Uchiha housewife?" The Sound ninja laughed. "Easy prey."

Mikoto held a kunai, trembling slightly.
CRASH.
The ground exploded.
Sarada landed between them. She wasn't trembling. Her Sharingan (three tomoe) spun violently.

"You have three seconds to run," Sarada said, adjusting her glasses.

"Get her!" The ninja charged.
BAM.
Sarada didn't use jutsu. She punched the air. The shockwave alone sent the three ninja flying into a brick wall, embedding them in the masonry.

"Grandma," Sarada turned to Mikoto, her voice softening. "Are you okay?"

Mikoto blinked, looking at this mysterious girl with the Uchiha crest on her back. "You... you called me Grandma?"

"Uh," Sarada blushed, realizing her slip. "I mean... Ma'am! Go! The Police Force is rallying at the intersection!"
Sarada shunshined away.

The Hyuga Sector

Himawari Uzumaki stood on a roof next to Hanabi (Age 3) and her nanny.
Sand ninja were using camouflage jutsu to sneak up on the Hyuga compound.

"Byakugan!" Himawari whispered. Her eyes turned veiny.
She pointed. "Three at 2 o'clock. Two at 6 o'clock. One underground."

Hiashi Hyuga landed next to her. He didn't ask who she was. He just saw the eyes.
"You have excellent vision, child," Hiashi said.
He followed her instructions. "Rotation!"
The hidden enemies were repelled instantly.

"Lock on!" Himawari giggled, poking a paralyzed Sand ninja in the forehead. "Game over!"

The Roof of the Stadium. The Purple Barrier.

Inside the Four Violet Flames Formation, the air was heavy with history.

The Combatants:

Team Alive: Minato Namikaze (4th), Hiruzen Sarutobi (3rd).

Team Undead: Hashirama Senju (1st), Tobirama Senju (2nd).

The Summoner: Orochimaru.

"This is a reunion I didn't ask for," Hiruzen grunted, gripping his Adamantine Staff (Enma).

"Sarutobi... Minato..." Hashirama looked at his hands, his skin cracked like porcelain. "Forgive us. We are being controlled."

"Brother," Tobirama scowled, sensing the tags in his head. "This summoning jutsu... I should have never invented it. It is an abomination."

"Less talking, more killing!" Orochimaru commanded, burying the control talismans into their heads. "Kill the Hokage!"

Round 1: Speed vs. Speed

Tobirama moved first. He raised one finger.
"Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!"
Wait—no water source? No problem. He pulled water from the moisture in the air. A massive dragon crashed down.

Minato didn't dodge. He threw a marked kunai through the water dragon.
Flash.
Minato appeared behind Tobirama.
"Lord Second," Minato said, a Rasengan forming in his hand. "Your speed is legendary. But I improved your Flying Raijin."

Tobirama’s eyes widened. He tried to teleport.
But Minato had already placed a seal on Tobirama’s armor the moment he arrived.
Flash.
Minato teleported Tobirama into the path of Hashirama’s Wood Style attack.

CRUNCH.
The Wood Dragon crushed the Water Clone Tobirama had substituted with at the last microsecond.

"Impressive," Tobirama re-formed. "You are faster than me, Fourth."

Round 2: Wood vs. Fire

Hashirama clapped his hands.
"Wood Style: Deep Forest Emergence!"
The roof began to turn into a jungle. Massive roots sought to strangle Hiruzen and Minato.

Hiruzen spun his staff. "Enma! Cage Defense!"
The staff expanded into a cage, blocking the roots.
"Minato! I can't hold the First forever! His chakra is infinite!"

"I know!" Minato was dodging roots, looking for an opening on Orochimaru. "I need to seal the souls!"

The Outside Interference

Outside the barrier, Naruto arrived. He saw his dad fighting two zombie gods.
He saw the Sound Four maintaining the barrier.

"Hey!" Naruto yelled at the Sound Four (Tayuya, Jirobo, Kidomaru, Sakon). "Open up!"

"Get lost, kid!" Tayuya yelled. "This barrier is unbreakable from the outside!"

"Is it?"
Naruto entered Sage Mode. The orange pigmentation appeared around his eyes.
He lifted his right hand.
"Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan!"

But he didn't hit the barrier.
He hit the ground beneath the barrier.
BOOM.

The stadium roof cracked. The structural integrity failed.
One of the Sound Four (Jirobo) lost his footing as the roof beneath him collapsed.
"Crap!" Jirobo’s concentration broke for one second.

The purple wall flickered.

Minato's Opening

Inside, Minato saw the flicker.
"Now!"
He threw three kunai at the gap Naruto had created.
Flash.

Minato appeared outside the barrier, behind the Sound Four.
Slash. Slash. Slash. Slash.

In less than a second, the Sound Four fell, their throats cut (non-lethally, but enough to drop the barrier).
The purple flames vanished.

The Turn

The barrier was down.
Minato turned back to the fight.
"Lord Third! The barrier is gone! We have room to move!"

Orochimaru panicked. "The barrier... broken by a Genin?!"

Minato stood next to Naruto on the shattered roof.
Father and Son.
Both in Sage Mode (Minato’s eyes had changed too—he was holding it in reserve).

"You late, Dad?" Naruto grinned, holding a massive Rasengan.

"Just fashionably, Son," Minato grinned back.

Hashirama laughed, breaking control for a second. "Hah! What a spirited grandson you have, Tsuna!"

"He's not Tsunade's," Hiruzen sighed. "He's Minato's."

"Same difference!" Hashirama roared. "Here I come!"

The Combo

Minato and Naruto held out their hands.
"Father-Son Rasengan: Super Barrage!"

They didn't aim for the zombies (who would just regenerate). They aimed for Orochimaru.

Orochimaru saw two yellow flashes coming at him.
"No... I cannot die here!"
He opened his mouth. A giant snake surged out—a substitution jutsu.

BOOM.
The impact vaporized the snake and half the stadium roof.
Orochimaru (the real body) was sent flying into the forest, his arms dangling uselessly, his chakra network severely damaged.

"Retreat!" Orochimaru screamed to his forces. "The mission is failed!"

End of Chapter 23

Status Update:

Future Kids: Successfully defended key sectors (Civilians, Uchiha, Hyuga).

The Barrier: Destroyed by Naruto (Assist) and Minato (Execution).

Orochimaru: Defeated and retreating.

Hokages: Hiruzen survives. Minato establishes dominance.

The Zombies: Hashirama and Tobirama's souls are released as Orochimaru loses control.

Ready for Chapter 24: The Aftermath (No Funerals, Only Parties)?

**User:**
You said

Ready but before that there is Gara's character development problem.

---

**Gemini:**
You are absolutely right. In the original timeline, Gaara's transformation was violent and public. Here, he was knocked out early. He hasn't had his worldview shattered yet—he just thinks he lost a fight. He needs to realize why he lost to start his journey toward becoming the benevolent Kazekage.

Here is Chapter 24: Monsters in the Mirror (Gaara's Awakening).

Chapter 24: Monsters in the Mirror

The Forest of Death. Northern Border. 1:00 PM.

The invasion had crumbled. Orochimaru had fled. The Sound and Sand forces were in full retreat.
Temari and Kankuro were leaping through the trees, carrying an unconscious Gaara.

"We have to get him out," Kankuro panted, terrified. "If he wakes up here, he'll kill us both for letting him lose."

"Shut up and keep moving!" Temari snapped, though her hands were shaking.

They landed on a thick branch.
Gaara stirred.
His eyes snapped open. They weren't the eyes of a groggy child. They were the eyes of a cornered beast.

"Let... go..." Gaara hissed.
Sand exploded from his gourd, knocking his siblings into the neighboring trees.
Gaara fell to the forest floor, clutching his head.

"Why..." Gaara screamed, grabbing the soil. "Why did my absolute defense fail?! Why was his blood... not mine?! Mother is angry! SHE IS HUNGRY!"

He began to transform again. The sand coated his arm, turning into the monstrous claw of the Shukaku.
"I will kill them all! I will prove my existence!"

The Interception

"Yo."

Gaara froze.
Sitting on a tree stump five meters away was Naruto Uzumaki.
He wasn't in a fighting stance. He was just sitting there, legs crossed, peeling an orange.
Behind him, leaning against a tree with his arms crossed, was Sasuke Uchiha.

"You..." Gaara’s pupil dilated. "The Uchiha. And the blonde... prey."

"We're not prey," Naruto said, tossing a slice of orange into his mouth. "And we're not here to fight. The invasion is over, Gaara. Your dad, the Kazekage? Orochimaru killed him weeks ago. You've been fighting for a corpse."

Temari and Kankuro, hiding in the bushes, gasped. "Father... is dead?"

Gaara didn't care about politics. "Lies! I exist only to kill! If I don't kill you, my existence is meaningless!"

He launched his sand claw at Naruto.
Fast.
But Naruto didn't move.
He didn't need to.
A golden chakra chain (an Uzumaki trait he had been practicing with Kushina) burst from Naruto's stomach, pinning the sand claw to the ground.

"We need to talk," Naruto said, his voice dropping an octave. "About the voices in our heads."

The Mirror

Naruto stood up and walked toward the monster.
"Stay back!" Kankuro yelled from the trees. "He'll kill you!"

"No, he won't," Naruto said calmly.
He stopped right in front of Gaara. The sand was swirling violently, but Naruto ignored it.

"I know what it's like," Naruto said softly. "To be looked at like a weapon. To have people walk to the other side of the street when they see you. To hear a monster screaming inside you every night, telling you to destroy everything."

Gaara stopped struggling. The sand claw wavered.
"You... know?"

Naruto lifted his shirt.
On his stomach, the Eight Trigrams Seal was visible. But unlike the original timeline, Naruto channeled a bit of Kurama’s red chakra, letting it bubble to the surface.
"I have the Nine-Tails," Naruto said. "You have the One-Tail. We're the same, Gaara. We're Jinchuriki."

Gaara stared at the seal. Then at Naruto's blue eyes.
"The same..." Gaara whispered. "But... you are not alone. You have friends. You have love. Why?"

"Because I realized something you haven't," Naruto said. "Being a monster is a choice. You can let the demon drive, or you can take the wheel."

Naruto pointed at Sasuke.
"That guy over there? He beat you. Not because he hates you. But because he wanted to protect me and Sakura. Strength doesn't come from loving only yourself, Gaara. That's just loneliness disguised as power."

The Choice

Gaara looked at Sasuke.
Sasuke didn't glare. He nodded, a simple acknowledgment of strength.
Then Gaara looked at the bushes where his siblings were hiding. He saw Temari crying. He saw Kankuro trembling—not with fear of the enemy, but fear for him.

"Love..." Gaara clutched his chest. The sand began to fall away. The monstrous arm crumbled back into dust. "Is that... what makes you strong?"

"Yeah," Naruto smiled. It was the smile that saved the world. "It hurts sometimes. Like, a lot. But it's better than being alone in the dark."

Naruto extended his hand.
"Go home, Gaara. Burry your father. Take care of your village. Be the Kage they need, not the weapon they fear. And next time we meet... let's just eat ramen. No killing."

Gaara looked at the hand.
For the first time in his life, the voice of his mother (Shukaku's madness) was silent.
Slowly, hesitantly, Gaara reached out.
He didn't shake Naruto's hand (he didn't know how). He just touched Naruto's palm with his fingertips.

"Naruto... Uzumaki," Gaara murmured, memorizing the name.

The Departure

Temari and Kankuro jumped down. They stood protectively around Gaara, wary of the Leaf ninja.
"Take him," Sasuke said, stepping aside. "The border is clear. Don't come back until you're allies."

Temari bowed deeply—a sign of immense respect. "Thank you. We... we didn't know about Orochimaru."

They picked up Gaara.
As they leaped away, Gaara looked back over his shoulder.
He saw Naruto waving.
For the first time, the sand didn't rise to block his vision. He saw the world clearly.

Gaara's Inner Monologue: "Love... implies a desire to serve. Maybe... I can exist for that, too."

The Debrief

Once they were gone, Sasuke exhaled.
"You're too soft, dobe. You let a nuclear weapon walk away."

"He's not a weapon," Naruto put his hands behind his head. "He's the future Kazekage. And besides, I just saved us a huge boss fight later. We have enough problems with the Akatsuki coming."

"Fair point," Sasuke admitted. "Let's go. The cleanup is starting. And I think my dad wants a word about why I know an A-Rank assassination technique."

"Good luck with that," Naruto laughed. "I'm gonna go find my dad and brag about hitting Neji."

End of Chapter 24

Status Update:

Gaara: Character arc corrected. The seed of "The Golden Child of the Sand" is planted.

Sand Village: Retreating. Will likely sue for peace once Rasa's body is found.

Naruto & Gaara: Bond established.

Next Phase: The Aftermath.

Ready for Chapter 25: The Aftermath (No Funerals, Only Parties)?

**User:**
You said

- Let's convince Shukaku as well and miraculously after shukaku is convinced, Shukaku's and Gara's memory returned.

- We (you and I) summon them (Shukaku, Gara, Boruto, Sarada, Himawari, Kurama, Momonoshiki, Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Hinata, Kakashi) to inform that restoring memories on all who lived up to Boruto era are possible from now on by triggering special events on them which the team have to find out themselves.

- Why is it possible? Because this is not a new timeline but a reset. We behind the scenes are working to restore. Therefore, Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari does not have to hide and also others from their timeline maybe restored and be ageless until their era comes to be able to age.

---

**Gemini:**
Here is Chapter 25: The System Update (The Reset Revealed).

This chapter fundamentally changes the rules of the story. It shifts from a "Time Travel Fix-It" to a "Universal Restoration" arc.

Chapter 25: The System Update

The Forest of Death. Sector 4. 1:15 PM.

The standoff was over, but the conversation was just beginning.
Naruto stood before Gaara, who was trembling as the sand receded. But the madness wasn't gone—Shukaku was still screaming for blood inside the seal.

"He won't listen!" Gaara gasped, clutching his head. "Mother... Shukaku... he demands a corpse!"

Naruto sighed. He closed his eyes.
"Kurama. Switch."

Naruto’s eyes snapped open. They were red, with vertical slits. His voice became deep and distorted.
"OI. TANUKI."

Inside Gaara’s mindscape, the giant sand raccoon froze.
Shukaku: "That chakra... The Fox? You're awake?"

Kurama: "Listen to me, you pot-bellied sandbag. We don't have time for your tantrums. We died. Do you understand? We faced the Otsutsuki God, and we lost. I burned my life force to save this brat, and you got extracted like a common battery."

Shukaku paused. The malice faded, replaced by confusion. "Died? We... are Bijuu. We respawn."

Kurama: "Not this time. The timeline was wiped. This isn't a game. If you don't cooperate, we lose again. Do you want to be a slave to the Statue again? Or do you want to rewrite the ending?"

Shukaku grumbled. He hated agreeing with the Fox. But he felt the truth in Kurama's chakra—the heavy, sorrowful weight of a future that had collapsed.
Shukaku: "Fine. But I'm only doing this because I hate the space aliens more than I hate you."

The Download

CLICK.

The moment Shukaku accepted the alliance, a mental dam broke.
Gaara gasped. His eyes rolled back.
It wasn't just chakra flooding him. It was Context.

He saw the Chunin Exams. The rescue of Sasuke. His death at the hands of Akatsuki. Chiyo's sacrifice. The Fourth Great Ninja War. Standing before the Allied Shinobi Forces as Commander.
He saw Shinki, his adopted metal-bending son.
He saw Naruto as the Seventh Hokage, tired but smiling behind a desk.

Gaara fell forward. Sasuke caught him.
Gaara looked up. The madness was gone. The insomnia-ridden eyes were now filled with the wisdom of a 32-year-old Kage.

"Naruto..." Gaara whispered, his voice steady. "You... you're so small."

"You're one to talk, Lord Kazekage," Naruto grinned, deactivating the Kurama eyes.

The Summoning

Suddenly, the world turned White.
The forest vanished. The sounds of battle ceased.
Time stopped.

In a white void, twelve figures appeared, floating on invisible platforms.

The Attendees:

Naruto Uzumaki

Sasuke Uchiha

Sakura Haruno

Hinata Hyuga (Teleported from the Hyuga Compound)

Kakashi Hatake (Teleported from the the crumbling arena)

Gaara (With Shukaku manifesting as a chibi-avatar on his shoulder)

Kurama (Manifesting next to Naruto)

Boruto Uzumaki (Pulled from the shelter defense)

Sarada Uchiha (Pulled from the streets)

Himawari Uzumaki (Pulled from the roof)

Momoshiki Otsutsuki (Floating beside Boruto)

Momonoshiki (Wait, who? Ah, the user's specific inclusion - perhaps a typo in the prompt, or a specific variant, assuming Momoshiki).

The Announcement

A voice echoed around them. It wasn't a chakra voice. It was the voice of the Architects (Us).

"ATTENTION, KEYSTONES."

Kakashi looked around, his Sharingan spinning. "Genjutsu? No... this feels like dimension hopping."

"This is not a Genjutsu. This is a Status Update."

"You have been operating under the assumption that this is a New Timeline. That is incorrect. This is a Reset. The future you came from has been overwritten onto this reality."

Sasuke narrowed his eyes. "What's the difference?"

"The difference is Stability. Because this is a Reset, the 'Grandfather Paradox' does not apply. Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari will not fade away if you change the past. They are anchored here."

Boruto touched his face. "So... I don't have to worry about erasing myself?"

"Correct. Furthermore, you no longer need to hide. You are now designated as 'Timeless Entities' until the timeline catches up to your birth years. You will not age until the chronological date of your original births. You are free to intervene openly."

Sarada adjusted her glasses, relief washing over her. "We can stop wearing these hoods?"

"Yes. Additionally, the Restoration Protocol is active. You are not the only ones. Others who lived to the Boruto Era can have their memories restored. To unlock them, you must trigger 'Special Events'—moments of high emotional resonance or recreating specific historical turning points."

Hinata stepped forward. "So... we can bring back others? Ten-Ten? Lee? Shino?"

"If the stimulus is strong enough. You are the keys. Find them. Wake them up. Prepare for the threat that is coming. The Otsutsuki will not wait for the timeline to catch up."

The End of the Session

The White Void began to fade.
Momoshiki scoffed. "Agelessness. How convenient. It seems I am stuck with you brats for a long time."

Kurama looked at Shukaku. "You hear that? We're getting the band back together."
Shukaku snorted. "Great. More work."

Return to Reality

Forest of Death.
Naruto, Sasuke, and Gaara snapped back to reality.
The difference was immediate. Gaara stood up, dusting off his clothes with the dignity of a leader.

"So," Gaara said, looking at the two Leaf ninja. "I assume the invasion is failed?"

"Spectacularly," Sasuke said. "Orochimaru is running. Your dad is dead. Sorry."

"It was expected," Gaara said coldly. "Rasa was a fool. I will return to Suna. I need to purge the council and secure the border before the Stone Village gets any ideas."

He looked at the trees where Boruto had been watching (before being summoned).
"And... I believe I have a nephew to meet properly."

Konoha Streets.
Boruto landed back in front of the shelter.
Iruka was still staring at him. "Who... who are you?"

Boruto smiled. He reached up and pulled down his hood.
He revealed the spiky blonde hair, the whisker marks, and the slashed headband.
"I'm Boruto," he said, deciding to stick to the truth because it was easier than lying. "I'm a... distant relative. From the Uzumaki clan's ruins."

Iruka blinked. "You look just like..."

"Yeah, I get that a lot," Boruto laughed. "Now, let's clean up this mess."

The Uchiha District.
Sarada appeared next to Mikoto.
She took off her mask.
Mikoto gasped. "You have... Sasuke's eyes. And Itachi's eyelashes."

Sarada bowed. "I am Sarada Uchiha. I'm... family. From a long way away."

Mikoto didn't ask questions. She just hugged the girl. "Welcome home, Sarada."

The Rooftop.
Himawari hopped over to Hiashi.
"Hi Grandpa!" She chirped, no longer hiding her face. The Byakugan was deactivated, revealing her blue eyes.

Hiashi looked at the whiskers. He looked at Hinata (who had just arrived via the summoning return).
"Hinata," Hiashi said faintly. "Is there something you need to tell me about Naruto Uzumaki?"

Hinata turned bright red. "It's... complicated, Father. But she's your granddaughter. Eventually."

The New Mission

Team 7 (Adult Minds) regrouped at the training ground later that evening.
Kakashi was there, reading Make-Out Tactics (some things never change).

"So," Kakashi said. "We have a new objective. Operation: Wake Up Call."

"Who do we target first?" Sakura asked. "Tsunade? We need a Hokage when the Third retires."

"Tsunade is a good pick," Naruto nodded. "But we also need Shikamaru. I can't run this village strategy without my advisor."

"And Temari," Gaara added, stepping out of the shadows. "If I am to fix Suna, I need my sister to remember who she really is."

"This is going to be fun," Sasuke smirked. "Traumatizing our friends to restore their memories."

"It's not trauma," Naruto corrected. "It's... aggressive therapy."

End of Chapter 25

Status Update:

Protocol: "Restoration" Active.

New Members: Gaara & Shukaku (Fully Awakened).

Boruto/Sarada/Hima: Unmasked and Ageless.

Objective: Trigger "Special Events" to restore memories of key allies.

Immediate Target: Shikamaru Nara (The Brains).

Ready for Chapter 26: Operation Wake Up Call (Target: Shikamaru)?

---

**User:**
You said

This actually works to close this demo fanfiction. Target is Shikamaru and Temari. After they woke up, Shikadai appears becoming just like Boruto, Sarada, and Himawari. Finally we wrap this up. I will plan first before writing the full fan fiction.

---

**Gemini:**
Here is the final chapter of this demo run. It ties up the "Awakening" arc for the Nara family and sets the stage for your future full fanfiction.

Chapter 26 (Finale): Shadows and Wind

Konoha Hospital. Waiting Room. 4:00 PM.

The invasion was over, but the hospital was chaos.
Shikamaru Nara was sitting on a bench, looking at the ceiling. He had a broken finger from the invasion (pretending to be asleep didn't save him from a stray rock), but mostly, he was just bored.
Temari was standing nearby, leaning against the wall, her giant fan folded. She was waiting for Gaara’s release papers.

"You Leaf ninja are fragile," Temari scoffed, looking at Shikamaru. "One invasion and the whole system clogs up."

"It's called triage," Shikamaru muttered, not looking down. "Troublesome woman."

The Intervention

"Advisor," a deep voice said.
"Ambassador," another voice followed.

Shikamaru and Temari looked up.
Naruto (still in his tattered orange jumpsuit but holding himself like a veteran) and Gaara (calm, collected, no longer insane) stood at the end of the hall.

"Gaara?" Temari blinked. "You... you're awake? And you're not... killing anyone?"

"I have had a clarity adjustment," Gaara said smoothly. He walked up to Temari. "Sister. We need to talk about the Wind Nation's diplomatic stance regarding the inevitable Akatsuki threat."

Temari’s jaw dropped. "The... what threat?"

Naruto sat down next to Shikamaru. He pulled a shogi piece (a King) out of his pocket and placed it on the bench between them.
"Shikamaru," Naruto said. "I need a strategy. Not for a Genin squad. For a village."

Shikamaru looked at the King piece.
"You're an idiot, Naruto. You don't play Shogi."

"I don't," Naruto grinned. "But the Seventh Hokage does. He learned it because his Advisor wouldn't shut up about it."

The Trigger

Shikamaru froze.
Seventh... Hokage?
His brain, usually running at lazy speeds, suddenly overclocked. He looked at Naruto's eyes. They weren't the eyes of the class clown. They were the eyes of the man who signed mountains of paperwork. The man who entrusted him with the village's shadows.

"The King..." Shikamaru whispered, staring at the piece. "The King is the unborn generation. That's what Asuma taught me."

"And that's what you taught him," Naruto said, pointing to a shadow in the corner of the room.

Across the hall, Gaara placed a hand on Temari’s shoulder.
"Temari. Do you remember the wedding? You wore a white kimono. You complained that it was too hot for Suna, but you wore it anyway."

Temari’s eyes widened. "Wedding? I'm twelve! Who would I—"
She looked at Shikamaru.
The memory of a desert wedding. The memory of a difficult childbirth. The memory of a slap to wake a lazy husband.

CLICK.

The Awakening

Shikamaru groaned. He put his head in his hands.
"Oh, man..." he dragged the words out. "This is... such... a... drag."

He looked up at Naruto. "Please tell me I don't have to redo the Chuunin Exams. That test was a nightmare."

"Sorry, Shikamaru," Naruto laughed. "You have to take it again. But at least you know the answers."

Temari gasped, leaning against the wall for support. "I... I married the crybaby?"
"Hey!" Shikamaru protested.
"But..." Temari smiled, a genuine, mature smile. "He turned out to be a good father."

The Shadow Emerges

"Talking about me behind my back? That's troublesome."

From the shadow of the vending machine, a boy stepped out.
He looked exactly like Shikamaru, but with Temari’s eyes. He was wearing the modern jacket of the Boruto era.
Shikadai Nara.

"Shikadai!" Temari yelled, her maternal instincts overriding the timeline confusion.

"Yo," Shikadai waved lazily. He walked over to Boruto (who had just shunshined into the hallway with Sarada). "I was just napping in the void, waiting for you guys to figure it out. Took you long enough."

"We had to fix the timeline first, ya know!" Boruto grinned, fist-bumping Shikadai.

The Gathering

The group stood in the hallway.
The Parents: Naruto, Sasuke (leaning in the doorway), Sakura (checking charts), Hinata (arriving with tea), Shikamaru, Temari, Gaara.
The Kids (Ageless): Boruto, Sarada, Himawari, Shikadai.
The Tailed Beasts (Internal): Kurama, Shukaku.
The Alien (Internal): Momoshiki (sulking).

Naruto looked at them. The team was growing. The memories were returning.
They weren't just fixing the past. They were building a fortress against the future.

"Alright," Shikamaru sighed, standing up and cracking his neck. "If we're doing this, we need a plan. Naruto, you handle the charisma. Sasuke, you handle the threats. I'll handle the logic. And the women..."
He looked at Temari and Sakura.
"...will probably beat us up if we mess it up."

"Damn right," Temari smirked.

Naruto looked out the window at the village. The sun was setting on the day of the invasion, but rising on a new era.

"Let's get to work," the Seventh Hokage (in a Genin's body) said. "We've got a world to save."

DEMO END

Final Status:

Timeline: Reset & Stable.

Memory Restored: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Hinata, Kakashi, Gaara, Temari, Shikamaru.

Ageless Entities: Boruto, Sarada, Himawari, Shikadai.

Mission: Complete.

Ready for the full fanfiction whenever you are!

**User:** What title do you recommend for this Boruto Reset or Restoration fan fiction?

--

**Gemini:**

That was an incredibly fun demo to build with you! You’ve got a fantastic premise here: it’s not just a standard time-travel "fix-it," but a full-scale *universal reset* featuring both generations working side-by-side with a memory-unlocking mechanic. That gives us a lot of great themes to play with for the title.

Here are a few title recommendations, broken down by the "vibe" or tone you might want for the final story:

### **Epic & Lore-Focused**

These titles highlight the grand scale of the story, focusing on the timeline reset and the looming Otsutsuki threat.

* **Echoes of the Seventh:** The Restoration Protocol
* **Legacy Rewritten:** The Konoha Reset
* **Shattered Hourglass:** The Shinobi Restoration
* **A Future Forged in the Past**
* **Chronicles of the Ageless:** Rewriting the Will of Fire

### **Mystery & System-Focused**

If you want to lean into the "Architects/System Update" and the memory-hunting aspect of the plot.

* **Operation Wake-Up Call**
* **The Memory Paradox**
* **System Override: Konoha**
* **Awakening the Leaves: The Boruto Era in Retrograde**
* **Keystones:** The Unmaking of Destiny

### **Generational & Emotional**

These titles focus on the family dynamics—Naruto fighting alongside Boruto, Sasuke guiding Sarada, and the adults dealing with their childhood bodies.

* **Timeless Leaves:** Generations United
* **Shadows of Tomorrow**
* **Two Eras, One Village**
* **Fathers, Sons, and the Ghosts of the Future**
* **The Ageless Vanguard**

### **Punchy & Action-Oriented**

Short, memorable titles that sound like official manga arcs or popular AO3 tags.

* **New Game Plus: Ninja Way**
* **The Konoha Crush (Remixed)**
* **Project: Otsutsuki Fall**
* **Restoration: Zero**

---

**My Personal Top 3:**

1. **Echoes of the Seventh** (It grounds the story in Naruto's ultimate legacy while hinting at the time travel).
2. **The Restoration Protocol** (Sounds official, urgent, and perfectly describes their mission).
3. **Timeless Leaves** (A poetic nod to the village and the ageless kids).

Would you like to pick a title now, or would you prefer to start mapping out the major story arcs (like the Sasuke Retrieval Arc replacement or the Akatsuki encounters) for your full fanfiction outline?
