The dispute was that the block size of Bitcoin was too small which causes slow transactions where simply the solution was increasing the block size.

Therefore, the solution was to create another Bitcoin fork or a new coin which shows the beauty of cryptocurrency where anyone can start their own."

      "quote": "Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee in October 2011 as a spinoff of Bitcoin, and is considered as one of the early alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Litecoin aims to be the “Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold” by taking on the best innovations of Bitcoin with a more lightweight approach to achieving Bitcoin’s noble goals. While Litecoin was created by cloning Bitcoin’s codebase, there are several key differences: (1) Block time, the Litecoin Network targets a block time of 2.5 minutes, while the Bitcoin network targets a block time of 10 minutes. This means that transactions can confirm faster compared to Bitcoin, and the network has a higher throughput. (2) Maximum supply, the Litecoin protocol states that there can be a maximum of 84 million Litecoin, while Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin. (3) Proof-of-Work Algorithm, Litecoin uses a different proof-of-work algorithm called Scrypt, while Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm. Scrypt is a memory-hard algorithm which was initially created to be ASIC-resistant. (4) Address, Litecoin addresses start with either “L” for legacy, non-Segwit addresses or “M” for Segwit-enabled addresses. Bitcoin addresses start with either “1”, “3” or “bc1”."

The Ripple foundation itself is well known for their efforts in building cooperations with authorities and banking entities which is the reason for its rise into one of the top cryptocurrencies. On the other side, they are disliked by some of the cryptocurrency communities especially from advocates of decentralization because the algorithm they used is the Ripple Consensus Protocol Algorithm (RCPA) where it is based on privately trusted nodes which makes some people suspicious that XRP is centrally controlled by Ripple."

Simply when the price is above $1, the algorithm encourages users to mint more DAI increasing the supply thus decreasing the price, and when the price is below $1, the algorithm encourages users to burn more DAI decreasing the supply thus increasing the price. The advantage of this algorithmic stable coin is that it is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be confiscated. The disadvantage sometimes the algorithm fails to keep the price at $1 but just wait and it will recover."
