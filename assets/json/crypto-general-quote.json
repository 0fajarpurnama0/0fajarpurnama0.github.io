The core technology is blockchain and further concepts are open, transparent, borderless, decentralized, unconfiscatible, pseudoanonymous and fixed supply of 21 Million BTC. All other cryptocurrencies follows these properties with some twists and turns. Ofcourse there are nagative aspects in reality."

Imagine anyone regardless of age, race, and background can participate in finance such as trading, investing, earning interest through deposit and other methods, lending & borrowing, and subscriptions without needing permission and cannot be stopped. No need for registration, verification, etc, just a press of few buttons. The demand pressure is because all services in this ecosystem uses ETH as the fee."

      "quote": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born due to the different opinions between Bitcoin developers. The dispute was that the block size of Bitcoin was too small which causes slow transactions where simply the solution was increasing the block size. However, changing the properties of Bitcoin is against the concept of Bitcoin should not be directed by anyone. Therefore, the solution was to create another Bitcoin fork or a new coin which shows the beauty of cryptocurrency where anyone can start their own."

One faction supports Roger Ver and Jihan Wu that maintains the Bitcoin Cash blocksize to 32 MB. The other faction supports Craig Steven Wright whom they believed to be the Satoshi Nakamoto whose claim is rejected by majority of the world and Calvin Ayre forking Bitcoin Cash into Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (SV) where the project believes to correct the Bitcoin protocol based on the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto with a blocksize of 128 MB."

      "quote": "Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee in October 2011 as a spinoff of Bitcoin, and is considered as one of the early alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Litecoin aims to be the “Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold” by taking on the best innovations of Bitcoin with a more lightweight approach to achieving Bitcoin’s noble goals. While Litecoin was created by cloning Bitcoin’s codebase, there are several key differences: (1) Block time, the Litecoin Network targets a block time of 2.5 minutes, while the Bitcoin network targets a block time of 10 minutes. This means that transactions can confirm faster compared to Bitcoin, and the network has a higher throughput. (2) Maximum supply, the Litecoin protocol states that there can be a maximum of 84 million Litecoin, while Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin. (3) Proof-of-Work Algorithm, Litecoin uses a different proof-of-work algorithm called Scrypt, while Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm. Scrypt is a memory-hard algorithm which was initially created to be ASIC-resistant. (4) Address, Litecoin addresses start with either “L” for legacy, non-Segwit addresses or “M” for Segwit-enabled addresses. Bitcoin addresses start with either “1”, “3” or “bc1”."

      "quote": "XRP is a distributed ledger created by Ripple Foundation to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges, enabling real-time settlement expeditions and lower transaction fees. The Ripple foundation itself is well known for their efforts in building cooperations with authorities and banking entities which is the reason for its rise into one of the top cryptocurrencies. On the other side, they are disliked by some of the cryptocurrency communities especially from advocates of decentralization because the algorithm they used is the Ripple Consensus Protocol Algorithm (RCPA) where it is based on privately trusted nodes which makes some people suspicious that XRP is centrally controlled by Ripple."

USDT is backed by USD where we can issue 1 USDT by depositing 1 USD to Tether Limited or vice versa claim 1 USD with 1 USDT. Many also called USDT a stable coin to the USD where it is useful to quickly and efficiently trade back and forth between cryptocurrency coins and USD. For example, it will be too late to sell when the market crashes because it takes too long to deposit to an exchange and usually the exchange breaks down during panic selling time. However with USDT, we can sell almost instantly and even vice versa. Investing in USDT is the same as investing in USD."

Bitcoin is pseudoanonymous where if the identity of the Bitcoin users is known, all that users transactions becomes transparent. Monero is anonymous making every transaction private based on the CryptoNote protocol with the privacy technology are RingCT, Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, Transactions over Tor/I2P, Dandelion++. In the world of increasing transparency, some users just needs privacy. However, this coin is highly disfavored by governments and higher authorities because it goes against their agenda of monitoring everything."

USDC is more trusted but the problem before 2020 is its low supply below 5 Billions where billionaires who wants to trade their coins to USDC cannot get enough. Even back then when I want to sell my coins to USDC, I got an expensive price because the lack of liquidity. However today there are 21 Billions in circulation."

      "quote": "Like USDT, DAI is designed to be $1, but unlike USDT it is not maintained by a single institution and not backed by actual dollars but maintained its price through algorithm created by Maker DAO. Simply when the price is above $1, the algorithm encourages users to mint more DAI increasing the supply thus decreasing the price, and when the price is below $1, the algorithm encourages users to burn more DAI decreasing the supply thus increasing the price. The advantage of this algorithmic stable coin is that it is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be confiscated. The disadvantage sometimes the algorithm fails to keep the price at $1 but just wait and it will recover."

Originally in 2013, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer forked Litecoin and Luckycoin into DOGE as a joke to the payment system and the wild speculations of cryptocurrency at the time.

In 2017, BNB was released as a utility coin to get discounts, VIP, and other promos at Binance Exchange. It is also similar to dividends as there are annual burns to increase the price of the coin using some of the company's profit thus holding BNB is like receiving some of the profits of the company. In 2021, BSC was released as the next popular alternative to Ethereum (ETH) where users can enjoy decentralized finance (DeFi) with much cheaper fees but there are rumors that it is less decentralized."

At the time, another alternative already existed and that is Tomo Chain (TOMO) which is also Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible which means that source codes in Ethereum Solidity can also work in Tomo Chain ecosystem. Like Tron and Binance Smart Chain, Tomo Chain provides larger scalability that allows faster and cheaper transactions in addition to its Proof-of-stake Voting (PosV) consensus algorithm. Another feature that differentiates TOMO with the rest of the DeFi ecosystem is that TOMO provides privacy enabled transaction."
