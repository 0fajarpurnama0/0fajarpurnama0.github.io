# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 1 – The Tourist Who Erased a Death Flag

![Capture Javelin](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/1.capture-javelin.jpg)

The late-afternoon sun painted Kuoh Town in lazy orange.  
Issei Hyoudou trudged across the small pedestrian bridge, muttering to himself about how the super-cute girl who asked him out had suddenly vanished after school.  
He never noticed the figure sitting on the railing above him, legs swinging like a bored child.

Black tactical long-coat, collar high, matte fabric drinking the light.  
Short black hair, one vivid red flower tucked behind the left ear.  
Emerald-green eyes that looked straight through the world instead of at it.

Kala Sofia Veritas finished the last strawberry Pocky stick, brushed the crumbs from her gloves, and tilted her head.

“Dragon aura density: 0.0003 % active, 99.9997 % dormant.  
Statistically improbable for a baseline human.  
Cute,” she murmured to herself, voice soft, almost singsong.

Below, a magic circle of black and violet flared without warning.

A fallen angel in a school uniform (Raynare, still wearing the fake smile of “Yuuma Amano”) materialised three metres in front of Issei.

“Sorry, pervert-kun. Orders are orders.”

A spear of light formed in her hand, longer than she was tall, edges humming with lethal holiness.

Issei had time for one strangled “Eh—?” before the spear flashed forward.

It never arrived.

Three centimetres from Issei’s heart, the spear simply… stopped.  
The light fractured into a thousand harmless motes, drifting away like dying fireflies.

Raynare blinked.  
Issei blinked harder.

From above, a gentle voice floated down.

“That was going to be a permanent casualty.  
Permanent casualties produce zero new narrative data.  
I’m on vacation, but I dislike waste.”

Kala hopped off the railing, landing without a sound.  
She walked forward at normal walking speed (no teleport, no burst of power), yet every step felt like the world politely moved out of her way.

Raynare hurled three more spears in blind panic.

Kala raised one gloved hand, caught all three between index and middle finger, and crushed them into glittering dust.

“Asked nicely,” she repeated, smiling brightly.

Raynare’s survival instincts finally overrode her pride.  
Black wings burst from her back; she shot into the sky and vanished beyond the rooftops.

Issei collapsed to his knees, clutching his chest that suddenly wasn’t pierced.  
Kala crouched in front of him, tilting her head like a curious bird.

“You’re bleeding internally.  
That’s inconvenient.”

She poked the exact spot once.  
A faint violet glow pulsed under her fingertip.  
Four seconds later the wound was gone, not even a bruise remaining.

Issei stared up at her, mouth opening and closing like a goldfish.

“W…what are you…?”

“Tourist,” Kala answered cheerfully, offering the empty Pocky box upside-down.  
“Oh, I ate them all.  
You’re welcome, though.”

Before Issei could process that, crimson light flooded the bridge.

Rias Gremory stepped out of her teleport circle, red hair fluttering, expression already set to “emergency rescue.”

Only to find her future pawn perfectly alive and a black-coated stranger smiling at her like they’d known each other for years.

Rias’s danger sense screamed louder than it ever had in her life.  
She literally could not sense anything from the girl (no demonic power, no holy power, no life force, nothing).  
Just a polite, friendly void wearing a red flower.

Kala waved with genuine delight.

“Crimson hair! Only 0.8 % of the global population.  
Hi! I just saved your future employee.  
You owe me coffee.”

Rias’s eyebrow twitched.  
Akeno, appearing half a second later, covered her mouth to hide an ecstatic shiver.

“My, my… what a terrifyingly cute onee-san♡”

Kala blinked innocently.  
“Terror is inefficient.  
I prefer tea, actually.”

Issei, still on the ground, raised a trembling hand.

“Prez… I think I need an explanation… and maybe new pants…”

Rias exhaled slowly, forcing her voice to stay level.

“…Occult Research Club. Now.  
Both of you.”

Kala clapped once, delighted.

“Field trip!  
I’ve never been inside a high-school devil base before.  
Do you have snacks?”

### The Next Evening – Abandoned Factory District

Raynare had brought reinforcements this time.  
Four fallen angels, dozens of light-spears, a killbox carefully prepared.

It lasted thirty-two seconds.

Kala stood beside Issei in the centre of the concrete lot, calmly eating taiyaki she’d bought on the way.

Every spear that entered a ten-metre radius froze mid-flight, crystallised, and shattered into rainbow dust.

Mittelt squeaked.  
Dohnaseek’s hat fell off.  
Kalamity started praying in Enochian.

Raynare, face pale with rage and fear, formed her strongest javelin yet (big enough to level the entire block) and screamed as she hurled it.

Kala took one step forward.

Caught the javelin bare-handed.

Crushed it.

The compressed holy energy detonated point-blank.

Issei was only human.

The shockwave shredded his uniform, ruptured organs, stopped his heart for 3.7 seconds.

Rias’s magic circle flared crimson beneath him.

Eight Pawn pieces slammed into his chest in perfect unison.

Issei’s eyes snapped open, glowing faintly red.

Rias stood over him, panting, hair wild, tears of relief and fury in her eyes.

Kala finished her taiyaki, brushed the crumbs from her gloves, and smiled at the four fleeing fallen angels.

“See? Canonical reincarnation event preserved.  
Efficiency restored.”

She turned to the newly reborn devil on the ground.

“Congratulations on your promotion, Issei-kun.  
Try not to die again; paperwork is tedious.”

Then she looked at Rias, head tilted, red flower catching the moonlight.

“Coffee and tea still on the table, right?”

Somewhere in the distance, Akeno’s sadistic giggle echoed like a promise.

### To be continued…

Your move.  
Do we jump straight to the morning-after clubroom scene (heat 25, taiyaki offering, first waves of possessive yuri tension), or do you want anything else before that?

# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 2 – The Clubroom Where Everyone’s Heart Rate Broke

![Club Room 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/2.1.club-room.jpg)

Old school building, Occult Research Club – 8:47 a.m.

Sunlight poured through tall windows, turning dust motes into slow-moving galaxies.  
The usual morning routine had been completely derailed.

Rias Gremory sat at the head of the table in her uniform, arms crossed so tightly the fabric creaked.  
Akeno stood behind her, smiling the smile of someone who had just discovered a new toy that could probably kill her and was very excited about it.  
Kiba leaned against the wall pretending to be calm, but his fingers kept twitching toward his sword hilt.  
Asia hadn’t arrived yet; she was still in the infirmary having a small panic attack after learning Issei had technically died last night.

Issei himself sat in the middle of the couch, bandaged under his uniform, staring at the black-coated tourist who had just walked in carrying a convenience-store bag like she owned the place.

Kala Sofia Veritas looked exactly the same as yesterday: long black tactical coat, red flower bright as fresh blood, gentle smile that made the room feel five degrees colder and ten degrees warmer at the same time.

“Good morning, everyone~”  
She raised the bag.  
“I brought breakfast! Taiyaki, melon-pan, and those little octopus sausages because they looked statistically adorable.”

She placed the bag on the coffee table, then leaned forward to peer at Issei.

“How are the new organs treating you? No rejection symptoms?”

Issei’s brain short-circuited.  
The way she leaned made the high collar of her coat part just enough to reveal smooth skin and the soft upper curve of very respectable breasts (nothing overtly exposed, but more than enough for a teenage pervert who had literally died twelve hours ago).

Blood immediately rocketed to his nose.

Rias slammed a hand on the table.  
“Issei! Control yourself!”

Akeno’s giggle was pure sin.  
“Ara ara, but Buchou, can you blame him? Tourist-san is being very… generous with her posture this morning♡”

Kala blinked twice, genuinely confused.  
“Generous? I’m just leaning. Gravity is doing the rest.”

She straightened up, coat falling back into perfect place, and offered the last red-bean taiyaki directly to Issei.

“Here. You lost a lot of blood yesterday. Iron and sugar help.”

Issei took it with shaking fingers.  
Their gloves brushed.  
Her hand was warm.

“T-thank you, Kala-san…”

“Just Kala is fine,” she said softly. “Titles create distance. Distance reduces observational accuracy.”

Rias pinched the bridge of her nose.  
“All right. Questions. Now.  
What exactly are you?”

Kala sat cross-legged on the table itself (completely ignoring the chairs) and began unpacking snacks with the serene happiness of someone at a picnic.

“Tourist,” she repeated, as if that explained everything.  
“I travel. I watch. Sometimes I nudge variables so the story doesn’t end prematurely. Yesterday your story tried to kill its own protagonist on page seven. That’s poor narrative hygiene.”

Kiba finally spoke, voice careful.  
“You neutralised four fallen angels and a holy-energy detonation with your bare hands.  
That’s not something a ‘tourist’ does.”

Kala tilted her head.  
“Efficiency. Attacking first generates unnecessary variables. I prefer to let hostile actors reveal their full move set, then correct the outcome with minimal deviation.”

She bit into a melon-pan, cheeks puffing slightly, and the room collectively forgot how to breathe for half a second.

Akeno leaned forward, violet eyes gleaming.  
“Kala-chan… do you have a boyfriend? Or a girlfriend? I’m not picky♡”

Rias’s aura flared crimson.  
“Akeno!”

Kala chewed thoughtfully.  
“Romantic entanglements are high-entropy events.  
They produce fascinating data, though.  
I’m… conducting field research.”

She turned her gentle smile on Akeno, and the Queen of Lightning actually shivered (half terror, half something much less innocent).

Rias decided to change the subject before her best friend spontaneously combusted.

“You saved Issei twice. I owe you a debt. Name your price.”

Kala’s eyes lit up like a child offered candy.

“Really?  
I want three things.”

She held up three fingers.

“One: unlimited access to this clubroom. It has excellent observational vantage points.”  
“Two: you let me follow Issei-kun around sometimes. His growth curve is statistically delicious.”  
“Three…”  
She paused, looked directly at Rias, and her smile became something ancient wearing a girl’s face.

“…don’t lie to me. Ever.  
I dislike when people hide variables.”

The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.  
Even the sunlight seemed to dim for a heartbeat.

Then the smile was back to normal, bright and harmless.

“That’s all!  
Do we have a deal, crimson-haired devil king?”

Rias swallowed.  
For the first time in her life, the heir of Gremory felt like prey that had just been allowed to live.

“…Deal.”

Kala clapped once, delighted.  
“Wonderful!  
Now, who wants the octopus sausages? They have little smiling faces.”

Issei raised his hand weakly.  
His nose was bleeding again.

Akeno whispered under her breath, just loud enough for Rias to hear:

“I’m going to hell for the thoughts I’m having right now, Buchou… and I’m dragging you with me♡”

Rias buried her face in her hands.

This was going to be the longest school year of her life.

Somewhere outside the window, the red flower in Kala’s hair caught the morning light like a drop of blood that refused to fall.

To be continued…

Heat level in this chapter: 27/100 (accidental cleavage, heavy flirting from Akeno, Rias’s possessive aura starting to crackle).

Your move:  
- Stay in the clubroom and escalate the teasing?  
- Skip to lunchtime on the roof with Asia’s introduction (pure cinnamon roll vs cosmic horror)?  
- Or fast-forward to the evening when Raynare inevitably tries round three?

Say the word and I’ll write the next full chapter (and generate any new images you want).

Got it. Crystal clear now.

Final, perfect version:

**Kala Sofia Veritas is a completely ordinary transfer student at Kuoh Academy**  

![Club Room 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/2.2.club-room.jpg)

…except she has zero obligations, zero missions, zero cosmic baggage, and happens to be omnipotent.

That’s it. No special titles, no “honorary stray”, no forged paperwork drama.

How it actually works in practice (100 % seamless, zero stress):

- She has a real student ID, real homeroom (2-B), real locker, real everything.  
- She attends whichever classes look fun that day. If she feels like sleeping in, she sleeps in. If she wants to sit in on third-year physics because “quantum looked tasty today”, she does.  
- Teachers never call on her, never give her homework, never mark her late—because the one time someone tried, the grade book spontaneously filled itself with perfect scores and a little doodle of a red flower. Nobody has dared since.  
- She wears the Kuoh girls’ uniform most days (and looks unfairly good in it), but keeps the black tactical coat draped over her chair like a cape. Sometimes she wears the coat instead of the blazer. Nobody says a word.  
- Lunch is always with the ORC group on the roof or in the clubroom. She brings homemade bentos sometimes because “cooking is a relaxing hobby”.  
- After school she either hangs out with Rias’s peerage, wanders town eating street food, or teleports to Okinawa for ten minutes because she felt like shaved ice.

In short:  
She is living the ultimate carefree high-school life that every DxD character secretly wishes they had, while casually no-selling fallen-angel spears and preventing apocalypses when they would interrupt snack time.

No duties.  
No missions.  
No responsibilities.  
Just a happy, slightly airheaded super-cute transfer student with a red flower in her hair who happens to be the strongest entity on the planet.

This is exactly what you wanted from the beginning.

So whenever you say “next scene”, we’re rolling with Kala as the chillest, happiest, most overpowered high-school girl in Kuoh history.

## Chapter 3 – Lunchtime on the Roof, Where the Sky Tastes Like Taiyaki

![Lunch Time Roof Top 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/3.1.roof-top-lunch.jpg)

Kuoh Academy rooftop, 12:18 p.m.

The spring breeze carried the faint scent of cherry blossoms and cafeteria curry.  
Kala Sofia Veritas sat on the ledge with her legs swinging, Kuoh uniform skirt fluttering just enough to be cute without being scandalous, black tactical coat draped over her shoulders like a cape because “the sun feels nice on my arms today.”

She had a bento box balanced on her lap that she’d made herself at 3 a.m. because she got bored.  
Tamagoyaki shaped like little dragons, onigiri with smiling faces, and a mountain of taiyaki because she discovered the mould at the hundred-yen shop and lost her mind for twenty minutes.

Asia Argento sat beside her, eyes sparkling like she’d met a real-life angel.  
Issei sat on her other side, trying (and failing) not to stare at the way Kala’s ribbon tie sat perfectly between soft, uniform-clad curves.  
Rias and Akeno claimed the bench behind them. Kiba leaned against the fence, pretending he wasn’t cataloguing every exit route out of sheer habit.

Asia clasped her hands together.  
“Kala-san… you really healed Issei-san yesterday without any magic circle or holy power?”

Kala offered her a dragon-shaped tamagoyaki.  
“Yep! Permanent death is just inefficient storytelling. I don’t like sad endings unless they’re earned.”  
She paused, tilted her head.  
“Actually, even then I usually rewrite them. Arshtat and Ferid from that one strategy game? Super rude. I fixed it.”

Issei choked on his juice.  
“You… fixed a video game?”

“Whole timeline,” Kala answered cheerfully, mouth full of taiyaki. “They’re alive, raising their kid, very happy. You’re welcome, internet.”

Rias’s eyebrow twitched.  
She was starting to suspect “transfer student” was the understatement of the millennium.

Akeno leaned forward, chin in her hands, violet eyes glowing.  
“Kala-chan~ Do you fix sad endings for people too? Or just fictional ones?”

Kala turned, red flower catching the sunlight like a tiny star, and smiled the gentlest, most terrifying smile in the universe.

“Tragedy is only beautiful when it’s optional.  
If someone I like is about to die permanently, I just… don’t let it happen.  
Simple!”

She said it like she was talking about changing TV channels.

Asia’s eyes filled with tears of pure worship.  
“That’s… that’s the most wonderful thing I’ve ever heard…”

Issei’s brain blue-screened.  
A girl who casually prevents tragic endings, looks like a model, cooks like a goddess, and is currently feeding him by hand (she had just popped a taiyaki into his mouth without asking) was sitting next to him.

His nose started bleeding again.

Rias stood up, hands on hips, trying to regain some authority.  
“Kala. Be honest. What exactly are you?”

Kala blinked twice, genuinely thinking about the question.

“Hmm…  
I guess I’m just me?  
I have a nice apartment in a place that doesn’t exist on any map, I own a ridiculous number of pocket dimensions shaped like cafés and beaches, and sometimes I project little pieces of myself into stories I like.  
Right now the piece is named Kala and she’s having the best school life ever.”

She beamed.

“That’s all!  
No missions, no prophecies, no evil overlords sending me on quests.  
Just snacks, friends, and making sure nobody I like dies stupidly.”

![Lunch Time Roof Top 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/3.2.roof-top-lunch.jpg)

She offered the last taiyaki to Rias.

“Want one, Prez? Red bean with extra chesto filling~”

Rias took it automatically.  
Her hand was shaking a little.

Akeno whispered, just loud enough for everyone to hear:  
“I’m going to marry her. Or let her step on me. Or both. Buchou, help.”

Kiba finally gave up pretending to be cool and just laughed.  
Koneko, who had appeared at some point with a bag of chips, nodded solemnly.

“…approved. Best senpai.”

High above them, a single red petal drifted from Kala’s flower and dissolved into sparkles before it hit the ground.

Somewhere far away, in a place that wasn’t a place, an infinite being who looked exactly like Kala smiled, kicked her feet, and whispered to no one in particular:

“This timeline is adorable.  
Ten out of ten, keeping it.”

Back on the rooftop, Kala leaned back on her hands and looked at the sky.

“So! What’s everyone doing after school?  
There’s a new crêpe place in front of the station and I have a coupon for unlimited strawberries.”

Five voices answered in perfect unison:

“I’m free!”

Even Rias.

Kala laughed, bright and clear, and for one perfect moment the entire rooftop felt like the safest, happiest place in all possible realities.

To be continued…

Heat level this chapter: 15/100 (pure wholesome with light nosebleed service).

Next scene options:
- Afternoon crêpe date (group or accidental one-on-one with any girl)  
- Evening: Raynare’s final, doomed assault (Kala ends it in 0.2 seconds whileily)  
- Next morning homeroom comedy when the teacher realises Kala got 100 % on the pop quiz she slept through

# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 4 – The Night Raynare Learned the Meaning of Overkill

![Church Again 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/4.1.church-again.jpg)

Abandoned church, 11:47 p.m.

The moon hung low and bloated over the ruined steeple.  
Raynare stood in the centre of the nave, wings spread wide, eyes manic with terror and pride.  
Issei faced her alone, red gauntlet glowing, sweat and blood mixing on his face.

Rias and the others waited outside the barrier Raynare had erected (devil power couldn’t cross it).  
Kala stood with them, wearing the Kuoh uniform blazer open over a black camisole, hands in her coat pockets, quietly humming the Oppai Dragon theme.

Inside the church:

Raynare laughed, high and cracked.  
“Even with your little toy, you’re still just a Pawn! Die already!”

She formed her strongest light-spear yet (the one that canonically pierces Issei’s skull and ends the fight permanently).

Issei gritted his teeth, Boosted Gear roaring.

“BOOST!!”

Kala’s humming stopped.

The spear flew.

0.2 seconds.

Kala took one casual step forward, raised her right hand, and flicked her index finger.

The light-spear simply ceased to exist.  
No explosion. No flash. It was there, and then it wasn’t, like a video file someone hit delete on.

Raynare’s eyes went wide.

Issei didn’t even notice the spear had vanished.  
He was already charging, gauntlet blazing crimson.

“DRAGON SHOT!!!”

The beam of pure draconic energy punched straight through Raynare’s torso.  
She looked down at the smoking hole in her chest, mouthed a silent “eh?”, and disintegrated into black feathers that scattered across the moonlit floor.

The barrier shattered.

Rias rushed in first, Akeno and Kiba right behind.

Issei stood in the middle of the ashes, panting, eyes wide with the realisation of what he’d just done.

Kala walked up beside him, pulled a strawberry milk from her coat pocket, and poked the straw in.

“Good job, dragon boy~”  
She offered it to him like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Issei took the carton with shaking hands.  
“…Did I just… kill her?”

“Yep! All you. One hundred percent canon hero moment.”  
Kala patted his head gently. “Permanent death was off the table, but you still earned every bit of that win. Proud of you.”

Rias stared at the spot where the spear had vanished, then at Kala.

“…You erased a holy weapon with a finger flick.”

Kala tilted her head.  
“It was going to mess up his character development if it hit.  
Growth arcs are sacred. Headshots are not.”

Akeno’s eyes were practically hearts.  
“Kala-chan is the best girlfriend material in all three factions…”

Rias elbowed her hard enough to crack a rib.  
“Focus!”

![Church Again 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/4.2.church-again.jpg)

Issei finally found his voice again.

“Kala… thank you. For letting me do it myself.”

Kala smiled, soft and warm and utterly devoid of cosmic weight.

“Anytime, Issei-kun.  
Now come on. Crêpe place closes in twelve minutes and I still have that unlimited-strawberry coupon.”

She turned and walked out of the church like she was leaving a convenience store.

The peerage followed, because at this point following Kala was the only thing that made sense anymore.

Behind them, the last black feather of Raynare dissolved into nothing.

The night smelled like strawberries and victory.

To be continued…

Heat level: 5/100 (pure action + wholesome aftercare).

Next natural scene:  
- The morning after: Asia’s summoning & church betrayal (Kala lets the emotional tragedy happen, only fixes the physical maiming).  
- Or jump straight to the Riser announcement and watch Rias slowly lose her mind trying to figure out how to explain Kala to her family.

# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 5 – The Morning After, and the Day Asia Fell

![Asia Trauma Heal 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/5.1.asia-trauma-heal.jpg)

Kuoh Academy, 2-B classroom – 8:12 a.m.

Sunlight slanted through the windows, dust motes dancing like tiny golden devils.  
Kala sat in the back row by the window, legs crossed, chin in hand, watching clouds that looked suspiciously like taiyaki.  
She had shown up in full uniform today, blazer buttoned properly for once, red ribbon tie perfect, black coat folded neatly on her desk like a sleeping dragon.

Issei walked in still looking half-dead from last night.  
He spotted Kala, managed a tired wave, and promptly face-planted into his desk.

Kala slid a carton of banana milk onto his desk without looking.

“Morning, hero. Hydrate or diedrate.”

Issei mumbled something that might have been “thank you, wife” and passed out again.

Across the room, Matsuda and Motohama were already whispering about the new transfer goddess who apparently vaporised fallen angels with finger guns.  
Kala heard every word, smiled sweetly, and the whispers mysteriously turned into compliments about how nice the weather was.

### Lunchtime – the summoning

The flyer appeared exactly on schedule:  
“Free healing for any injury or illness – abandoned church, tonight only.”

Rias’s face went pale the instant she saw it.  
Akeno’s smile turned razor-sharp.

Kala just tilted her head.

“Asia-chan’s debut episode, right?  
This one’s going to hurt her feelings more than her body.”

Rias looked at her sharply.  
“You know what’s going to happen?”

“Yep. She heals an enemy, gets called a witch, wings torn out, left to die. Classic exile arc.”  
Kala’s voice stayed light, almost singsong. “Emotional damage is part of her growth. Physical mutilation is not. I’ll wait until the exact frame the tragedy becomes permanent, then fix the body. Soul stays bruised. Perfect balance.”

She popped a strawberry Pocky into her mouth like she was discussing the weather.

Rias opened her mouth, closed it, and finally just sighed.

“…I hate that I’m starting to get used to this.”

### That night – the church, again

![Asia Trauma Heal 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/5.2.asia-trauma-heal.jpg)

The scene unfolded exactly as written:

Asia healed “Yuuma” (Raynare in disguise).  
The fallen angels revealed themselves.  
Accusations of heresy.  
Wings ripped out in a spray of golden feathers.  
Asia collapsed, bleeding, crying, alone.

Kala stepped out of the shadows the instant Asia hit the floor.

She knelt, brushed golden hair from the ex-nun’s tear-streaked face, and smiled the gentlest smile in all timelines.

“Hey, Asia-chan. Rough day, huh?”

Asia looked up through tears.  
“I… I’m a witch… I can’t go back to Heaven…”

Kala cupped the girl’s cheek, violet light flowing from her palm like warm water.  
Broken wings re-formed in seconds, pristine and glowing. Blood vanished. Pain gone.

“You’re not a witch. You’re just kind.  
And kind people deserve friends who won’t abandon them.”

She scooped Asia up bridal-style (Asia weighed nothing in her arms) and stood.

“From now on, you have a new home.  
It has cake, hugs, and a pervert who will worship the ground you walk on. Sound good?”

Asia stared,, then burst into fresh tears (happy ones this time) and buried her face in Kala’s shoulder.

Outside, the ORC waited exactly where they were supposed to.

Rias’s magic circle was already glowing.

Kala walked straight into it carrying Asia like a princess carrying another princess.

Issei’s jaw dropped.

Rias recovered first.  
“…Welcome to the family, Asia Argento.”

Kala set Asia down gently, ruffled her hair, and pulled a single taiyaki from her coat pocket.

“Welcome-home snack. Red bean and custard swirl. I made them at 4 a.m. because insomnia is a hobby.”

Asia took the taiyaki with trembling hands, bit into it, and started crying again (this time from sugar and overwhelming safety).

Akeno leaned over to Rias and whispered:

“Buchou, I’m stealing her. You can have Issei. I’m keeping the wife.”

Rias’s eye twitched so hard it was audible.

Kala just laughed, bright and carefree, and the night smelled like warm custard and new beginnings.

To be continued…

Heat level: 8/100 (pure comfort, zero fanservice this time).

Next natural beat:  
- First full day with Asia in the clubroom (culture shock + everyone fighting to adopt her).  
- Or jump to the Riser announcement and watch Sirzechs meet Kala for the first time.

# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 6 – The Day Asia Became Everyone’s Little Sister (and Kala Became Everyone’s Wife)

![Asia Roof Top 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/6.1.asia-roof-top.jpg)

Occult Research Clubroom – after classes

The old school building had never been this loud.

Asia stood in the doorway in her brand-new Kuoh Academy uniform (Rias had pulled every string to get her enrolled the same morning), clutching her school bag like a life raft.

Kala immediately abandoned the couch, bounded over, and hugged her so hard Asia squeaked.

“Welcome to the chaos family, Asia-chan! ♪”  
She spun the smaller girl once, then set her down gently. “I saved you the best seat and the strawberry melon-pan.”

Asia’s eyes went full sparkle-mode.  
“K-Kala-san… you’re so kind…”

Issei, already seated, stood up so fast he knocked over three chairs.

“Asia! You’re here! You’re safe! You’re—”  
He noticed the uniform skirt.  
His brain rebooted with a loud Windows error sound.

Koneko silently slid an entire tray of cookies in front of him and patted his head like a dog.

Rias cleared her throat, trying to regain control of her own clubroom.

“Everyone, this is Asia Argento, former nun, new Bishop of the Gremory peerage, and officially under our protection.”

Akeno stepped forward with the most predatory smile in recorded history.

“Asia-chan~ From today on you can call me Onee-sama♡”  
She glanced sideways at Kala. “Or you can call Kala ‘Mommy’, I’m not picky.”

Rias’s aura flared crimson so hard the windows rattled.

Kala just laughed and pushed a second melon-pan into Akeno’s hands.

“Eat sugar before you combust, lightning wife.”

Akeno actually blushed.

Kiba offered Asia a perfect gentlemanly bow and a slice of homemade pound cake.

Koneko wordlessly placed a lap blanket over Asia’s knees the moment she sat down.

Issei was still frozen, nose bleeding.

Asia looked around the room, eyes filling with tears again, but this time they were the good kind.

“Everyone… is so nice… I’ve never had friends before…”

Kala plopped down beside her, slung an arm around her shoulders, and declared to the entire room:

“New rule! Anyone who makes Asia cry (bad tears) gets turned into a taiyaki and eaten.  
Good tears are fine. Happy crying is mandatory.”

Asia hiccupped, then laughed through her tears and hugged Kala around the waist.

Rias watched the scene with the expression of someone whose carefully planned peerage had just been adopted by a walking catastrophe of kindness.

She gave up and smiled.

“…Welcome home, Asia.”

### Five minutes later – snack apocalypse

The coffee table looked like a bakery had exploded.

Kala had produced (from her coat, somehow) three full boxes of limited-edition strawberry Kit-Kats, two bags of seasonal taiyaki, a thermos of hot chocolate, and a tiny mountain of Pocky.

Asia’s eyes were literally stars.

Issei finally managed to speak.

“Kala… how do you carry all that…?”

“Pocket dimension shaped like a 24-hour konbini,” Kala answered, mouth full. “It has mood lighting and a cat that works the register.”

Nobody even questioned it anymore.

### Later – rooftop, golden hour

![Asia Roof Top 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/6.2.asia-roof-top.jpg)

The whole peerage (plus one very clingy ex-nun) sat in a loose circle watching the sunset.

Asia leaned against Kala’s side, half-asleep with a content smile.

Kala was braiding tiny sections of Asia’s hair and slipping little red flower clips in (exact copies of her own flower, just smaller).

Rias watched them for a long time, then spoke quietly.

“Thank you. For giving her a soft landing.”

Kala didn’t look away from the braid she was working on.

“Everyone deserves at least one place where they’re loved exactly as they are.  
I just made sure she found hers a little faster.”

Akeno rested her chin on Rias’s shoulder from behind.

“Buchou… we’re keeping her forever, right?”

Rias sighed, defeated and happy.

“…Obviously.”

Issei raised a trembling fist.

“Seconded! Motion carried!”

Koneko nodded once. “…thirded.”

Kiba just smiled and took a photo with his phone.

High above them, the sky turned cotton-candy pink.

Kala finished the last tiny braid, tucked the final flower behind Asia’s ear, and whispered so only the sleeping girl could hear:

“Welcome to the best timeline, Asia-chan.”

Somewhere, in a place that wasn’t a place, an infinite being wearing Kala’s face kicked her feet and grinned.

“Adoption complete.  
Cuteness levels critical.  
10/10, no notes.”

To be continued…

Heat level: 2/100 (maximum fluff, zero fanservice, weaponized wholesomeness).

Next natural beat:  
- The morning Riser’s engagement letter arrives (and Grayfia shows up to meet the walking anomaly).  
- Or a quiet weekend sleepover at Rias’s mansion where everyone fights over who gets to cuddle Asia/Kala.

# High School DxD: Veritas Vacation  
## Chapter 7 – Revised & Expanded: The Day Riser Phenex Learned Fear Tastes Like Strawberry Taiyaki

![Riser Entrance 1](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/7.1.riser-entrance.jpg)

Occult Research Clubroom – Thursday, 3:28 p.m.

The flaming circle spat out Riser and his entire harem exactly as canon intended.

Riser strutted forward, arms wide.

“Rias, my beloved fiancée! Time to stop playing with trash and come home to a real man.”

Issei’s fists clenched so hard the Boosted Gear sparked.

Riser noticed, smirked, and decided to twist the knife exactly like the original script.

“Look at this pathetic Pawn. Dreaming of being Harem King?”  
He snapped his fingers. His entire peerage pressed against him in a wave of perfume and barely-there clothing.

“This is what a real harem looks like, pervert.”

He yanked his Queen, Yubelluna, forward and kissed her hard, one hand sliding down to grope her openly in front of everyone.

Issei’s face went from red to purple.  
Veins popped. Boosted Gear roared.

Riser pulled away from the kiss with a smug chuckle.

“See? This is power. This is status. You’ll never—”

Kala, who had been quietly watching from the couch with Asia asleep on her lap, finally moved.

She lifted Asia gently, set her on a cushion, and stood.

The room temperature dropped anyway.

Riser felt it first. His flames flickered like candles in a storm.

Kala walked forward at normal speed, hands in her coat pockets, red flower bright and innocent.

She stopped one metre from Riser.

Then she smiled the exact same carefree smile she used when offering melon-pan.

“Hi again, chicken-kun.  
You just did the canon taunt scene perfectly. Ten out of ten delivery. Issei needed that rage fuel for his Balance Breaker unlock later. Good job.”

Riser opened his mouth to sneer.

Kala kept talking, voice still light.

“But you crossed the live-studio-audience line when you groped her without consent in front of children.”

Yubelluna suddenly found herself standing three metres away, fully clothed, blinking in confusion.

Riser’s hand was now empty.

Kala tilted her head.

“Consent is mandatory in every timeline I visit. House rule.”

A single red petal drifted from her flower and hovered in front of Riser’s face.

His regeneration flames guttered out completely.

For the first time in centuries, Riser Phenex felt cold.

![Riser Entrance 2](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/kala-tragedy-fixer/7.2.riser-entrance.jpg)

Kala’s smile never changed.

“I’m not going to stop your arc. You still get to be the perfect arrogant catalyst. Issei still gets to hate you enough to punch through dimensions with his fists. Rias still gets her dramatic rebellion. All of that stays.”

She leaned in until she was nose-to-nose with him.

“But touch anyone in this room without enthusiastic permission again, and I will erase the concept of ‘Phenex’ from every history book, every family tree, and every regeneration cell in your body. Permanently.”

She booped his nose with one finger.

“Understood?”

Riser nodded so fast his neck cracked.

Grayfia, who had been frozen the entire time, finally found her voice.

“…We will reconvene for the Rating Game in ten days.”

The magic circle yanked the entire Phenex group away before Riser could embarrass his bloodline any further.

Silence.

Then Issei whispered, voice shaking with leftover rage and brand-new awe:

“She… she just made an immortal apologize with a finger boop…”

Asia, still half-asleep, mumbled: “Kala-oneechan is the coolest…”

Rias sat down hard.

Akeno’s eyes were practically hearts.

Kala spun once, coat flaring dramatically, and opened her arms.

“Group hug before the trauma sets in! Also I have phoenix-shaped taiyaki and the middle finger on mine is anatomically correct.”

She held up one pastry that was, indeed, flipping the bird.

Issei started laughing so hard he cried.

Rias buried her face in her hands, shoulders shaking with something between sobs and hysterical laughter.

Grayfia’s voice floated back through the closing circle, faint and broken:

“Sirzechs-sama… bring the 1787 bottle. And the emergency chocolate.”

Kala waved cheerfully.

“Tell him to pair it with the strawberry ones!”

To be continued…

Exact canon beats preserved:  
- Issei’s jealousy and rage fully triggered  
- Riser’s taunting and groping scene happened  
- Everyone got exactly the emotional fuel they needed  
- Kala only stepped in after the necessary character moments were complete, and only to enforce the “no non-consensual touching” rule

Perfect balance of canon growth + Kala’s carefree dominance.

Ready for the next chapter whenever you are ♡
