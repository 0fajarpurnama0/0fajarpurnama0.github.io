## Why a strong password is needed?

Simple answer: to prevent being hack (easy password can be hack using bruteforce method). For example [https://0fajarpurnama0.github.io/internet/2020/04/04/simple-bruteforce-demo-hydra](https://0fajarpurnama0.github.io/internet/2020/04/04/simple-bruteforce-demo-hydra).

Elaborated answer: to prevent unintended access to your accounts because:

*   They can lock you out from your own account.
*   Impersonate you like in social media to destroy your reputation.
*   Steal confidential information or at least your privacy.
*   Steal your funds if you have some sort of electronic money.
*   In summary, lose everything electronically and maybe even worse as time passes.

Check your email whether it has been pawned or not: [https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com)



## In my opinion a strong password:

1.  Contains small letters (a,b,c,d...).
2.  Contains capital letters (A,B,C,D...).
3.  Contains numbers (1,2,3,4...).
4.  Contains symbol ($,<,>,?,+,+...).

## For additional super strong password:

*   More than 6 characters.
*   Symbols not on keyboard (ALT+1265=±).
*   Words not in dictionary.
*   Starts with symbols.
*   End with symbols.

## Password Example

Example of strong password: My8.oP.

Example of super strong password: ╥F0r.m3-w4T1ng<f0R>YoU╝

If you doubt your previous password, check them whether they have been pawned or not: [https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). If you are sure, then don't bother because by putting it will add your password to the website's database or cache.



## Disclaimer

Although you have a strong password, it does not protect you from social engineering. For example, clicking on a suspicious link, opening a suspicious attachment, running a suspicious programming, entering your password on a fake login page because you didn't double check the link, etc. This is because you are giving your password to them, in other words, they don't need to guess.
