## Chapter 1 – The Unremarkable Transfer and the Weight of Regret
8:00 AM – Day 1: Kuoh Academy
Ariel Caelum Veritas walked through the front gates of Kuoh Academy, the perfectly pristine private school uniform feeling tight and strangely scratchy over his slightly soft, unfit body.
The Observer Channel was silent, granting him the immersion he needed.
He looked exactly as intended: a young man of average height, slightly rumpled black hair, and a face that was pleasant but instantly forgettable. The most noticeable features were the barely-there layer of fat around his waist and the constant, subtle tension in his shoulders—the physical anxiety of the unpopular guy.
He knew the plot, the setting, and the players. He walked past the main building and instantly spotted his target: two students near the student council office.
Sona Sitri (The Queen) and Tsubaki Shinra (The Vice-Queen).
He approached them, forcing a pleasant, neutral smile.
"Excuse me, I'm Ariel Caelum Veritas. I'm the new transfer student starting today. Could you point me toward the faculty office?"
Sona Sitri, the President, paused her conversation. Her eyes, sharp and intelligent, swept over him.
Internal Data (Sensory/Observation - Baseline): Sona Sitri Aura: Dense, cold, and organized Demonic Power. Status: High-Class Devil, Queen Piece. Senses nothing unusual from Ariel (registers as Human Baseline).
She offered a polite, professional smile—the kind she used for every mundane student. "Of course. The faculty office is on the first floor, third door on the left. Welcome to Kuoh."
"Thank you, Sitri-kaichou," Ariel replied, using her official title to maintain distance. He offered a small nod to Tsubaki (The Queen's Vice), who merely looked through him, already back to business.
He walked away, a knot of familiar, painful emotions tightening in his stomach.
Regret Check: Minimal Interaction. Zero interest shown by either powerful female figure. Status: Invisible. Regret Fulfilled: Social Invisibility Confirmed.
This confirmed his base level of unpopularity. The grind was real, both socially and physically.
10:30 AM – Morning Class: The Observer
Ariel sat in the back row of his first class, 2-C. His desk was near the window—the perfect observation point.
He focused his mind, not on the lecture, but on the first stirrings of Energy Sensing (SPR 0.0).
Target: Issei Hyoudou. (Issei was in the adjacent class, but Ariel focused on the concept).
He reached out mentally, searching for the raw power signatures the plot described.
Feedback: Nothing. He could detect the rough shape of the school building, the sound of the air conditioning, but not the deep, latent, sleeping power of the Boosted Gear.
Self-Correction: Too weak. My Inner Pilot Light is still a candle unlit. I need \text{SPR} 0.5 just to register the existence of these forces.
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. The effort of the mental focus, combined with the mild physical discomfort of his body, was exhausting.
He glanced around the classroom. No one was looking at him. No girls were whispering about him. He was a silent, friendly, forgettable presence.
The perfect cover.
4:00 PM – End of School: The Anti-Harem Code
Ariel walked out of the school gates, keeping a respectful distance from the crimson-haired beauty getting into a sleek black car—Rias Gremory. He saw the fleeting glimpses of the ORC members (Akeno, Kiba, Koneko), but made no effort to interact.
He chose a different path home than Issei, deliberately avoiding the main plot trajectory for the first three days. He found his desolate, anonymous apartment.
He pulled off the confining uniform, revealing the slight physical softness, and looked at his reflection—the representation of the regret.
> [Observer Channel - Active.]
> Observer: "First Day of Observation complete. Social Status: Unremarkable. Aura Perception: Zero. Mission Goal: Functional Baseline is now Critical. Raynare attacks in two days."
> 
Ariel dropped into a fighting stance, the basic martial arts form coming instantly to mind. He didn't try a kick; his body would fail.
"I need the strength," Ariel confirmed, his voice now steel-hard, stripped of the polite school-day veneer. "I need the Inner Pilot Light before I encounter even the weakest Fallen Angel."
> User: "Then enter the forge, Ariel. Tonight, we begin the true struggle. We focus on Physical Augmentation and the Deadlift. We will not stop until your current 0.8 PHY can pull 100\text{ kg} clean."
> 
Ariel closed his eyes, visualizing the featureless grey room and the heavy iron bar.
"Loading PTD Scenario: 100\text{ kg} The Weight of Regret."
Now we dive into the Physical Grind.
Let's detail the first hour of his PTD training, focusing on the pain and struggle against his slightly overweight condition to achieve that 100\text{ kg} deadlift.

8:00 PM – PTD Module 1: Physical Augmentation
Ariel stood before the 100\text{ kg} barbell in the infinite grey of the PTD. His body, still slightly soft and carrying the excess weight, burned with exhaustion from the day's mental stress.
> Observer: "Scenario: 100\text{ kg} The Weight of Regret. Target: 10 clean repetitions. Note: Your current physical inefficiency means every rep costs 1.5 \times the energy a fit human would expend. You must overcome this psychological drag."
> 
Ariel gripped the bar. He focused his mind—the MND 1.5 was the only thing holding him together. He wasn't relying on magic; he was relying on the sheer will of the Heavenly Destroyer (Gosu, God of Highschool) to force his 0.8 PHY body to obey.
Pull.
The bar rose, shaking violently. His lower back screamed, the excess fat around his core feeling like a heavy, suffocating belt. He completed the rep, dropping the bar with a deafening CLANG.
He took one minute to recover, his face slick with sweat, his heart pounding against his ribs.
> Observer: "Repetition 1 complete. PHY Gain: 0.001. Current \text{MND} usage: 45\%. Projected failure point: Repetition 6."
> 
Ariel pushed the warning aside. He used his burgeoning Sensory/Observation focus to analyze the pain—not as agony, but as a data point. He identified the weak stabilizers in his shoulders (regretting the years of slouching) and the tightness in his hips.
He forced Repetitions 2, 3, and 4. Each one was a miniature battle of will against physics. By Repetition 5, his vision was tunneling, and he fell into the deep, animalistic focus required of a true fighter.
Repetition 6: He pulled, and the bar stopped halfway. His muscles seized. He felt a sharp, simulated pain in his hamstring—the HRVR reminding him that a real strain would cost him days.
He held the bar there, frozen, for seven agonizing seconds, pouring all his conscious intent into the lift.
> User: "Remember the Silhouette, Ariel. The path of the legend is forged here. You wanted to prove that the payoff is earned."
> 
With a guttural cry, Ariel forced the bar the final few inches, completing the rep. He collapsed, shaking, the smell of simulated burnt muscle filling his nostrils.
> Observer: "Repetition 6 complete. \text{MND} usage: 95\%. Temporary PHY Gain: 0.005 (due to near-failure). Current Deadlift Max: 100\text{ kg} (near failure)."
> 
Ariel knew he couldn't do four more reps. Not tonight.
"Training adjustment," Ariel gasped, pushing himself against the wall. "Switch focus. Need Energy Sensing to stabilize \text{SPR} and recover \text{MND}."
9:30 PM – PTD Module 2: Energy Mastery (Meditation)
The weight room dissolved, replaced by a Zen Garden Module. Soft light, the sound of flowing water, and comfortable cushions.
> Observer: "Scenario: Inner Pilot Light. Target: \text{SPR} 0.5. Your goal is to find your own life force—the Dao—the stable center within your conscious will. Failure to achieve this means zero progress in energy manipulation."
> 
Ariel sat cross-legged, closing his eyes. He forced his mind to ignore the blinding pain of his body. He searched for the Dao (The Steward Demonic Emperor), the spiritual core beneath the physical pain.
He found nothing but noise—his heart hammering from the deadlifts, his anxiety whispering about his social failures, the regrets of the past.
He focused on the teachings of Bleach's Aizen—the idea of standing above the chaos, of absolute self-control.
A wave of calm washed over him as he mentally suppressed the pain data.
He pushed deeper, and for a fleeting, perfect moment, he felt it: a tiny, warm spark deep in the center of his chest. It was his own life force, his Inner Pilot Light—the 0.001\% of his potential.
> Observer: "Stable connection achieved. \text{SPR} 0.5 threshold met. Current \text{SPR}: 0.5. You can now faintly sense your own life-force and detect raw, high-level energy signatures (e.g., Rias Gremory) as an abstract 'pressure' if they are within 50\text{ metres}."
> 
Ariel opened his eyes. He felt centered, calm, and oddly satisfied. The pain hadn't vanished, but his mind had mastered it.
10:00 PM – PTD Module 3: Sensory/Tactical Application
The Zen Garden faded, replaced by the chaotic, low-fidelity graphics of a PTD VR RPG: Kuoh Academy Campus (Bully Module). .
> Observer: "Scenario: Social Isolation Gauntlet. Practical training for Sensory/Observation and tactical application. Goal: Navigate the hallways and cafeteria without provoking a fight, but precisely track the movements of the target NPC: The Bully (Biff)."
> 
Ariel was rendered in the VR world as a slightly plain, slightly chunky male student. He moved through the crowded, locker-lined halls.
The challenge wasn't fighting; it was reading the room. He used his newly sharpened \text{MND} and reaction time reduction to track the subtle cues:
 * The Bully's Pattern: He saw Biff (a hulking, generic NPC) leaning against a locker. Ariel mentally calculated the fastest, least-trafficked route past him.
 * Reading the NPCs: He registered the micro-expressions of the background students—the ones who flinched, the ones who avoided eye contact, and the one girl who was clearly watching Biff's movements with fear. This allowed him to predict Biff's lunge 200\text{ ms} before it happened.
 * The Tactical Dodge: Biff lunged to trip him. Ariel smoothly shifted his weight, using the basic martial arts footwork he knew theoretically, but applied with the new, dense efficiency from his deadlift training. He wasn't fast, but he was perfectly efficient.
Ariel sidestepped the trip. He didn't hit back. He just continued walking, the Biff NPC bewildered by the perfect evasion.
> Observer: "Successful evasion. Sensory/Observation Gain: + 10\text{ ms} reduction in reaction time. You used your knowledge of social pressure to predict the attack and your burgeoning efficiency to evade without wasted motion. Tactical goal met."
> 
2:00 AM – End of Training
Ariel exited the PTD, the sterile white returning him to his desolate apartment. His body was screaming in agony—real, physical pain from the intense focus and simulated strain. He felt like he'd been hit by a truck, but his mind was sharp and centered.
He looked at his slightly overweight body in the mirror. No visible change. But he knew the truth.
[Current Status Check (Internal): PHY 0.806 (Functional, but soft). \text{MND} 1.55 (Sharper). \text{SPR} 0.5 (Stable).]
He had achieved a minimal functional baseline. He had two more nights of this before Raynare attacked Issei.

## 🗓️ Day 2: The Pain and the Polite Distancing
Ariel's goals for Day 2 are two-fold: Friendly, but Non-Committal Interaction with a key ORC member (testing his Anti-Harem Code) and Deepening the Unpopularity Cover against his own body's increasing internal strength.
8:15 AM – Kuoh Academy Gates: The Internal Struggle
Ariel walked through the gates again, wearing the same slightly rumpled uniform. Externally, he looked like a sleepy student. Internally, he felt like a bruise. Every muscle fiber he'd stressed with the 100\text{ kg} deadlift was screaming in simulated agony—a real, dull, constant ache the HRVR training had imprinted upon him.
Internal Data (Sensory/Observation - Focus): He focused on the pain, refusing to let it affect his posture. This control was part of the Physical Augmentation training: forcing a fit mindset onto an unfit body.
Regret Check: He consciously slowed his pace, ensuring his gait reflected the mild physical inefficiency of his slightly overweight frame. He was actively acting the unpopular, slightly out-of-shape student to preserve the spice.
11:30 AM – Hallway Encounter: The Anti-Harem Test
During the passing period, Ariel found himself near the Occult Research Club building. Koneko Toujou, the tiny, silent Rook of Rias's peerage, was walking alone, carrying a massive stack of school documents.
Ariel recognized the opportunity. Koneko was guarded and highly perceptive. Interacting with her was a good test of his friendly but distant policy, and an excellent opportunity to test his Energy Sensing against her Devil Aura.
He approached her with a neutral, non-threatening posture.
"Toujou-san," he said gently, nodding at her load. "That looks heavy. Here, let me get the top half."
Without waiting for a response (or risking an awkward social pause), Ariel smoothly slipped half the stack from her arms, using the efficient, practiced movement he'd honed in the PTD's tactical drills.
Koneko paused, her golden eyes widening by a fraction of a millimeter. She didn't typically let strangers touch her or her work.
Internal Data (Energy Sensing - SPR 0.5): Ariel felt a faint, cold pressure emanating from her—like a tiny, humming tuning fork in the back of his mind. It was the Demonic Aura. It wasn't detailed, but it was there. Success.
"It's just to the faculty office, right?" Ariel asked, keeping his tone calm and purely helpful.
"It... is," Koneko replied, her voice soft and suspicious. She was trying to read him, sensing his lack of supernatural power, yet detecting a strange, unflappable calmness.
Ariel smiled—a genuine, easy smile that was just friendly enough. "Glad I could help. Hard work is easier with two people."
They walked in silence to the office. Ariel handed the papers over, offered a small nod, and immediately broke off the interaction before it could escalate.
"Have a good afternoon, Toujou-san."
He walked away, leaving Koneko staring after him, her brow slightly furrowed. Why did he help? No ulterior motive. No flirting. Just… efficiency.
Anti-Harem Test: Passed. He gained positive, intimate interaction (shared burden) without triggering romantic interest or crossing the line of the Code. His unpopular cover remained intact, enhanced by the confusion of the peerage member.
4:30 PM – Apartment: The PTD Focus Shift
Ariel returned to his empty apartment, the day's fatigue layered over the previous night's muscle ache. He had achieved minimal social integration, but the Raynare deadline was tonight.
> Observer: "Ariel, your physical output is currently capped by your soft tissue. We must prioritize Sensory and Will Projection tonight. Raynare's attack is tonight. You need the Presence Projection to intimidate if necessary."
> 
"Understood," Ariel affirmed. "I need the basics of the Legendary Silhouette. The aura of fear that precedes the reality."
> User: "The goal tonight is the Initial State of Will Projection. To focus your conscious intent into a non-physical presence. We use the most demanding mental training module."
> 
8:00 PM – PTD Module 4: Will Projection (The Dao of the Heart)
The PTD loaded the scenario: The Abyss of Ego. Ariel was placed in a featureless black void. There was no pain, only the terrifying challenge of Absolute Isolation.
> Observer: "Scenario: Presence Projection (Fear Aura). Target: Momentarily impose your mental intent onto the environment. You must confront the core of your regret—the overwhelming sense of less than—and overwrite it with the unshakable resolve of the Heavenly Demon."
> 
Ariel sat in the void. He felt the mental landscape of his teen self rise up: the insecurity, the anxiety of social judgment, the feeling of always being on the periphery. This was the "monstrous self" from Aku no Higan—not a monster of power, but a monster of self-doubt.
He concentrated on the teachings of the Heavenly Demon and the Dao of the Heart (The Steward Demonic Emperor). His will was not a weapon; it was a decree.
I am the Mortal Variable. I am the effort that negates the cheat.
He focused all his MND 1.55 and his meager SPR 0.5 into a single point. He didn't try to be angry or intimidating; he tried to be absolute. He decreed his own existence.
For a split second, the black void around him shivered. The air grew cold, heavy, and undeniably present. It wasn't Demonic Power, or Holy Power. It was the raw, pure willpower of a conscious mind overriding reality.
> Observer: "Initial State achieved. Will Projection (Presence) Unlocked. Current \text{MND} usage: 100\%. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.1. You can now project a momentary, non-magical Fear Aura that might cause low-level humans to freeze for half a second."
> 
Ariel collapsed, not physically, but mentally exhausted. He felt the terrifying weight of his own Presence—the power that comes from being unshakable.
"It is... exhausting," Ariel whispered.
> User: "It is the power of the silhouette, Ariel. Legends don't need to yell. They just need to exist with absolute resolve. Now, rest. You are fully deployed. The plot starts now."
> 
6:00 PM – Kuoh Town: Deployment
Ariel exited the PTD, dressed quickly in his casual clothes, and left the apartment. He knew the canonical timing. Issei was heading home now.
Ariel followed the path he knew Issei would take, keeping a distance of three blocks. He was moving with the slow, deliberate pace of someone who was physically unfit, but his senses were screaming.
His \text{SPR} 0.6 was constantly active. He could now perceive the ambient pressure of the supernatural world.
There.
He felt a sudden, dense spike of cold, dark Demonic Aura and a nearby flash of aggressive, blinding Holy Power (Raynare's disguise). The battle was starting.
Ariel stopped three blocks away, standing in the shadow of a convenience store. He felt the sudden, localized surge of power that indicated the first contact.
His first chance to act as the Silhouette.
[Current Status Check: PHY 0.806 (Soft, but hard-willed). \text{MND} 1.55 (Razor Sharp). \text{SPR} 0.6 (Pilot Light Active). Will Projection: Ready for single use.]
9:30 PM – PTD Module 2: Energy Mastery and Soul Calming (Revised)
The weight room session ends with Repetition 6, leaving Ariel in agonizing simulated pain and physical failure.
The module dissolves, replaced instantly by the Zen Garden Module. Soft light, the sound of flowing water, and comfortable cushions.
> Observer: "Physical Augmentation Session complete. Muscle Group Stress: 110\%. Entering mandatory Recovery Mode. You have 30 minutes before the next module. Engage Existence/Soul Calming."
> 
Ariel sat cross-legged, but instead of simply meditating to achieve \text{SPR} 0.5, he immediately channeled his newfound Inner Pilot Light (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.5) into his screaming muscles.
He used his MND 1.55 to issue a mental command: Heal.
He visualized his Existence—his entire being, his soul essence—as a calming, neutral river (inspired by the Dao). He mentally directed this flow to the muscle fibers damaged by the simulated deadlift failure.
He focused on:
 * Relaxation: Consciously dropping the residual tension left by the physical stress, starting with his shoulders and moving down to his overtaxed hamstrings.
 * Stretching/Flow: Executing slow, precise, mental stretching of his tendons and ligaments, visualizing the smooth flow of inner energy to dissolve any blockages caused by the strain (reflecting the martial arts concept of smooth energy flow).
 * Emotional Regulation: Using the Soul/Existence to calm the surge of panic and self-doubt ("I can't lift that much!") induced by the HRVR. He replaced the panic with the unshakable resolve of the silhouette.
> Observer: "Recovery Efficiency: 15\%. Soul Calming Successful. Muscle recovery time reduced by 10 minutes. \text{MND} remains high; emotional stability restored. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.05 (due to active energy direction)."
> 
Ariel opened his eyes, feeling the pain dull to a manageable ache. The exercise was mentally taxing but spiritually restorative. He had actively used his Soul to conquer his Body's limits.
This integration ensures that every moment Ariel spends not fighting is spent training his spirit and energy control, directly contributing to his ultimate goal of Authoritative Reality Projection (Will Projection).
Now that Ariel is fully recovered and his \text{SPR} is slightly boosted, we proceed to the critical deployment moment on the evening of Day 3 (Raynare's attack).

Chapter 1 (End) – The Silhouette and the Stabilized Timeline
6:45 PM – Kuoh Town: The Intervention
Ariel stood three blocks away in the shadow of the convenience store. His internal \text{SPR} 0.6 was screaming. He felt the cold, familiar spike of Demonic Aura (Rias arriving) and the deadly, focused Holy Power (Raynare's spear) converging on the target location—the park bench where Issei had just been confessed to.
He knew the time frame was impossibly tight. Issei would be hit and mortally wounded before Rias could materialize. Ariel's task was to buy a micro-second of stabilization.
Ariel moved.
He didn't activate Burst Speed at 100\%; his unfit body couldn't sustain it. He channeled a meager \text{PHY} 0.005 to create a short, efficient burst of acceleration—the kind of sudden, impossible speed one sees in high-level martial arts masters.
He covered the distance in seconds, arriving at the edge of the pedestrian bridge just as Raynare (as Yuuma Amano) materialized her light spear and lunged at Issei Hyoudou.
The Moment of Truth: Will Projection
Ariel slammed all his available Will Projection (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.6) into the air, focusing it entirely on Raynare.
It wasn't a physical attack; it was a pure, psychological Presence Projection—the Legendary Silhouette focusing its intent.
In that micro-second:
 * Issei saw nothing but the spear about to pierce his chest.
 * Raynare suddenly felt the impossible weight of an absolute, unmoving will. It was colder, denser, and infinitely more focused than any Holy or Demonic Power she had ever sensed. It was the feeling of a primal entity decreeing that her current action was inefficient.
Her motion didn't stop, but her aim—her conviction—faltered by a millimeter. The spear, still deadly, shifted its trajectory just enough.
The spear drove into Issei's chest, right where his heart was.
Issei screamed, collapsing instantly as the holy power vaporized his organs.
The Aftermath: The Silhouette's Footprint
Raynare, panicked and utterly terrified by the unreadable presence that had just choked her will, didn't stay to confirm the kill. Her black wings burst forth, and she vanished instantly, her mind reeling from the encounter with the unreadable Human Variable.
Ariel watched her flee. He did not pursue.
He walked calmly to the fallen Issei, his slightly overweight body moving with the heavy, exhausted gait of a man who had just run a marathon. He knelt beside the body.
> Observer: "Intervention Successful. Raynare's attack was slightly destabilized, ensuring a fatal but immediately salvageable wound. Canonical requirement for death/reincarnation is preserved."
> 
The air shimmered crimson. Rias Gremory materialized instantly, her expression a mix of terror and focused fury. She saw the impaled Issei and, standing over him, the new, slightly sweaty transfer student she'd seen in the halls—Ariel.
Rias's aura flared as she looked at Ariel, searching, analyzing, and finding nothing. He registered as less than a background character, yet he was standing right where the most powerful holy weapon strike had just occurred.
Ariel did not speak to Rias. He simply looked at the dying Issei.
"The debt is paid," Ariel murmured, confirming his role to his Observer Channel. "The process is stable."
He then stood up, took one final look at Rias as she began the hurried incantation, and walked away slowly, blending back into the shadows of the evening.
His last sensation before he turned the corner was the flash of eight Pawn Pieces descending onto Issei's body.
Mission Goal: Plot Stabilization achieved.
8:00 PM – PTD: Recovery and Analysis
Ariel stumbled back into his apartment and instantly entered the PTD. He collapsed onto the Zen Garden floor, completely depleted.
> Observer: "Performance Review: Will Projection (0.6 \text{ SPR}) was 100\% effective at achieving micro-second psychological disruption. **Physical Augmentation (0.806 \text{ PHY}) **is exhausted. You need immediate recovery."
> 
Ariel immediately engaged Existence/Soul Calming (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.65). He focused the Dao flow on his overtaxed nervous system, prioritizing the recovery of his \text{MND} for the coming days.
He knew the fallout would be immense. Tomorrow, he would be a silent observer to the chaos he had indirectly stabilized.

## 🗓️ Day 4: The Friendly Greeting and the Aura
8:05 AM – Kuoh Academy Gates: The Hangover
Ariel arrived at school, his body feeling like lead after another night of brutal \text{MND} and \text{PHY} training. He was still wearing the same slightly rumpled uniform, maintaining his cover as the forgettable transfer student.
He walked into his classroom (2-C) and spotted him instantly: Issei Hyoudou, sitting at his desk, looking completely exhausted and deeply confused.
Ariel approached his desk with his inherited friendly nature.
"Hey, Hyoudou," Ariel said with a kind, easy smile, leaning slightly on the desk to show his approachability.
Issei looked up, his eyes dull. He dimly recognized Ariel as the guy who'd transferred in two days ago, but his memory of the previous night was a shattered mess of pain and crimson light.
"Uh... hey, Ariel-kun. You doing okay?"
"Me? Yeah, I'm great. But I saw you yesterday," Ariel said quietly, his voice lowering to show sincerity. "You seemed like you were in a bad way. A fall, right? That looked really painful. You doing okay now?"
Ariel was casually checking on him, but his internal Energy Sensing (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.65) was roaring.
Internal Data (Aura Check): Issei Hyoudou Aura: Demonic Power detected! Faint, but constant. Density: Low-Class. Source: Reincarnation Magic. Conclusion: He is saved, but different. The Observer Channel's warning was correct, and the crimson girl was a powerful helper.
Issei winced, rubbing his chest unconsciously over the place where the spear had struck. "Yeah... just a bad fall. I think I hit my head. But yeah, I'm fine now. Weird dream, though."
Ariel nodded, his smile sincere. "Glad to hear it, man. If you need anything at all—a quick chat, homework notes, anything—just ask. I'm Ariel." He extended a friendly, sweaty hand.
Issei, relieved by the casual, friendly sincerity (the kind of kindness he rarely received), shook his hand warmly. "Thanks, Ariel. I'm Issei. Nice to meet you."
Ariel maintained the handshake for a moment longer than necessary—a friendly habit.
Internal Confirmation: Physical contact confirmed the Aura. The canonical timeline has been set. The struggle continues.
"Cool, Issei," Ariel said, releasing his hand and giving him a small, respectful nod. "See you around."
Ariel walked back to his seat, having successfully confirmed the major plot point and integrated himself into Issei's social orbit as a casual, friendly acquaintance—the good guy on the periphery.

🌃 Night 4: The Sentinel's Senses and the Grind
8:00 PM – PTD Module 1: Physical Augmentation (Shedding Regret)
Ariel entered the PTD and immediately loaded the weight room. He still had to hit his physical target, and he couldn't let up, despite the crushing fatigue.
> Observer: "Scenario: Weight Loss & Core Stability. Target: 100\text{ kg} deadlift, 8 repetitions. Focus: Eccentric Control. This maximizes muscle tear and forces high metabolism, accelerating the shedding of soft tissue."
> 
Ariel stared at the barbell. He was sore, but the active Soul Calming recovery from the previous night meant he could function. The lift was still a massive struggle against the inertia of his slightly overweight body.
He forced the first rep. It was shaky. He deliberately focused on the slow descent (eccentric control), fighting gravity all the way down. The simulated pain was instant and deep—a tearing burn.
He completed 8 repetitions, collapsing onto the mat, his entire body shaking and slick with sweat. He had pushed himself past his previous failure point (6 reps) through sheer will and the efficiency gained from PTD.
> Observer: "Physical Augmentation complete. Repetitions successful. \text{PHY} Gain: 0.003. Current Deadlift Max: 110\text{ kg} (near failure). Note: Observable soft tissue reduction: 1\%. The process is slow, but effective. You are functionally stronger, but your appearance remains the same."
> 
8:45 PM – PTD Module 2: Active Recovery and Existence Calming
The scene shifted to the Zen Garden. Ariel immediately engaged Existence/Soul Calming (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.65). He focused the Dao flow on his core muscles, which were now the primary target for fat reduction.
He didn't just relax; he used his will to smooth the new, dense energy flow around the overworked muscle fibers, accelerating the healing process necessary for tomorrow's training.
> Observer: "Recovery efficiency: 20\%. Soul Calming Stabilized. \text{SPR} Gain: 0.02. You have stabilized your energy pathway following the extreme exertion. Current \text{SPR}: 0.67."
> 
9:30 PM – PTD Module 3: Sensory/Observation (The Sentinel's Eye)
Ariel transitioned to the most critical training for survival: Sensory/Observation. Now that he knew supernatural attacks were real, he needed to react before the danger manifested.
> Observer: "Scenario: Micro-Movement Prediction & Threat Identification. Goal: Achieve 25\text{ ms} reaction time reduction. The module will present 100 simulated threats (knives, projectiles, subtle magical attacks). You must identify the intent and sidestep the attack before the animation completes."
> 
The environment loaded: a dimly lit, chaotic street scene. Ariel faced a hologram of a disgruntled gang member with a hidden knife. .
Ariel focused his MND 1.55. He ignored the weapon and focused only on the muscles in the hologram's face and forearm—the microscopic twitch that precedes the lunge (The Boxer).
The gang member lunged. Ariel didn't move fast, he moved perfectly efficiently, using a slight shift of weight to evade the attack by millimeters.
He repeated the drill 100 times. Each attempt pushed his mind to process information faster, seeking the pre-cognition level of the legendary figures (like Bills or Itachi).
By the end of the session, his eyes were burning, but his mind felt terrifyingly sharp.
> Observer: "Sensory/Observation Session complete. Reaction Time Reduction: 30\text{ ms} (Exceeds Target). \text{MND} Gain: 0.05. You can now predict a simple, un-magical physical attack approximately 200\text{ ms} before the average human recognizes the threat. This is a critical edge."
> 
11:30 PM – PTD Module 4: Tactical Application (MGS VR)
Ariel loaded the new module, shifting from social tactics to pure combat simulation.
> Observer: "Scenario: Stealth & Non-Lethal Takedown (Metal Gear Solid VR Module). Goal: Infiltrate a small, guarded compound and neutralize two guards using non-lethal, efficient martial arts. Focus on speed and minimizing noise. This is practical application of your new burst speed and efficiency."
> 
The PTD rendered a small, generic military compound under moonlight, complete with patrolling guards who had realistic, cone-of-vision visual systems. Ariel was equipped only with his hands.
He used his Sensory/Observation to track the guards' patrol paths and predict the micro-pause in their steps. He utilized his Burst Speed and efficient martial arts footwork to dart from shadow to shadow, his slightly heavier frame moving with impossible quiet.
He executed a clean, single-touch takedown on the first guard (a quick neck chop), and a silent chokehold on the second. He was efficient, quiet, and fast.
> Observer: "Tactical Application complete. Non-Lethal Takedown rating: 100\% efficiency. This training solidifies your ability to use physical skill as an equalizer against superior numbers. Tactical Gain: Minor, but stable."
> 
1:00 AM – End of Training
Ariel exited the PTD, his body aching but his mind centered and aware. He had confirmed the supernatural threat was real and dedicated himself completely to the grind.
[Current Status Check: PHY 0.809 (Slowly hardening). \text{MND} 1.6 (Sharper, faster). \text{SPR} 0.67 (More stable). He still looks like the friendly, slightly overweight transfer student, but his efficiency and senses are now terrifyingly high.]

## 📅 Day 5: Observation and the Demonic Aura
Ariel's goals for Day 5 (Friday) are to use his enhanced \text{MND} and \text{SPR} to confirm the new reality of the supernatural, solidify his friendly cover with Issei, and make his first deliberate observations of the ORC's power.
8:00 AM – The School Gate: Reading the Aura
Ariel walked onto the Kuoh Academy grounds. His 30\text{ ms} reduction in reaction time and stabilized \text{SPR} 0.67 made the world feel slightly slower, and slightly louder. He was actively listening with his soul.
He immediately registered the three primary Aura Signatures that had begun to coalesce around the old school building:
 * Crimson & Dense: The overpowering, regal aura of Rias Gremory.
 * Violet & Electrified: The smooth, dangerous power of Akeno Himejima.
 * Faint & Chaotic: The new, weak, yet distinctly Demonic aura of Issei Hyoudou.
He spotted Issei walking through the gate, still looking exhausted from his reincarnation. Ariel made a beeline for him, maintaining his friendly, slightly overweight exterior.
"Hey, Issei! Rough night, buddy," Ariel greeted him with a wide, genuine smile, placing a friendly hand on his shoulder.
Issei jumped slightly, still jumpy from the trauma. "Ariel? Oh, yeah. Rough night. The dream was... really weird."
Ariel's hand lingered just long enough to confirm the Demonic Aura—it felt like a low-frequency hum under his palm. Confirmed. The power is real, and it's weak.
"Tell you what," Ariel said kindly. "We should grab some lunch on the roof today. I packed a ton of taiyaki—extra sugar might help with the 'weird dreams.'"
"Taiyaki?" Issei's eyes lit up, momentarily forgetting his fatigue. "Yeah, I'd like that, Ariel. Thanks."
Ariel's interaction was purely motivated by kindness, yet it served the crucial mission objective: establishing a reliable link to the target.
10:30 AM – Morning Class: The Anti-Harem Code in Action
During the passing period, Ariel walked past the notorious trio of perverts—Matsuda and Motohama—who were inevitably staring at the passing female students. Ariel, still maintaining his unpopular cover, politely nodded to them as he passed.
A petite, silver-haired girl with a perpetual scowl passed them: Koneko Toujou.
Ariel's Sensory/Observation detected the shift in her aura. She was radiating the faint, cold \text{Demonic Aura} (\text{SPR} \text{ } 0.67 was just enough to perceive the raw energy). However, his new ability allowed him to focus on the micro-expressions she was using to conceal her irritation at the perverts.
She is moving precisely to avoid their line of sight. Prediction: She will kick them if they speak.
Matsuda opened his mouth to make a comment. Ariel, acting purely on his kindness and quick prediction, smoothly stepped between them, seemingly to grab a drink from the vending machine, interrupting the line of sight and the comment.
"Oh, excuse me, Toujou-san! Morning!" Ariel greeted her with a friendly, casual smile.
Koneko paused, her golden eyes locking onto him. She remembered him from the shared paper-carrying task—the friendly guy with no ulterior motives. She only gave a small, silent nod, but the intensity of her hidden \text{Demonic Aura} instantly diminished.
Anti-Harem Test: Passed. Ariel achieved another positive, non-romantic interaction with a key peerage member, defusing a canonical moment of minor aggression through simple, kind-hearted efficiency. He did not ask her out, did not compliment her body, but simply acknowledged her politely, respecting her space.
12:30 PM – Lunch on the Roof: Observing the Controller
Ariel and Issei sat on the rooftop ledge, sharing the homemade taiyaki (custard and red bean). Issei was visibly less focused on girls and more focused on the excellent snacks.
"Man, this taiyaki is awesome, Ariel," Issei munched happily. "You made these?"
"Yeah, cooking is a good way to stay focused," Ariel replied with a slight chuckle, enjoying the warmth of the friendly interaction—a soothing balm for his social regret.
A red flash announced the arrival of Rias Gremory and Akeno Himejima. They were there to check on Issei, their newest Pawn.
Rias's eyes instantly found Ariel. She still couldn't sense any power from him, yet he was sitting casually next to her new, crucial Pawn, sharing food. This was irritating her carefully ordered world.
Ariel's Sensory/Observation was working overtime:
 * Rias Gremory: Aura: Pure, dense crimson power. She is radiating possessiveness toward Issei. Micro-Expression: Her lips are tight, and her eyes are analytical. She doesn't trust Ariel's presence.
 * Akeno Himejima: Aura: Electric violet, smooth and dangerous. She is radiating amusement. Micro-Expression: Her eyes crinkle at the corners, watching Rias's irritation and Ariel's oblivious friendliness.
Akeno walked up first, smiling. "Ara ara, Ise-kun, already making new friends? And fresh taiyaki! Hello, Ariel-kun."
"Hello, Himejima-san," Ariel replied with his best friendly, non-flirty smile. "Want one? They're still warm." He offered the box.
Akeno took one gracefully. "Why thank you. You're very kind."
Rias simply stared at Ariel, unable to categorize him. She saw the slightly overweight, friendly boy offering snacks, yet her instincts screamed Anomaly.
"Hyoudou," Rias commanded, her voice firm. "We need to discuss your new duties this afternoon at the ORC. You should bring your... friend."
Rias didn't trust Ariel enough to leave him alone. By inviting him, she could keep him within her observation zone.
Ariel smiled, accepting the invitation as a simple invitation to hang out with new friends. "Sounds good! I'd love to check out your club. Is there a theme?"
Akeno giggled, answering for Rias. "Of course, Ariel-kun. The theme is fun."
4:00 PM – The Occult Research Club: The True Scope
Ariel followed Issei into the old school building, his senses buzzing. He sat quietly on a side chair as Rias tried to explain the concept of Devils and Reincarnated Pieces to a bewildered Issei.
Ariel listened, processing the bizarre mythology. Magic systems, sacred gears, alternate dimensions... the voice was right. This is definitely not a normal high school.
He maintained his passive, friendly demeanor, using the opportunity to run a deep Sensory/Observation scan on the entire room:
 * Kiba Yuuto: A strong, contained \text{Demonic Aura}. His movements are sharp, fast, and precise (like a swordsman in a tactical manhwa).
 * Koneko Toujou: A surprisingly powerful, dense \text{Demonic Aura} for her size. It feels cold and compressed.
 * The Room Itself: The ORC room is a nexus of hidden magic. Ariel mentally mapped the ambient energy sources, improving his Energy Sensing through sheer exposure.
Ariel sat there, the kind, quiet, slightly overweight transfer student, pretending to be mystified by the talk of Devils, while his \text{MND} and \text{SPR} were rapidly compiling a strategic database of his new, dangerous world.
> Observer: "Day 5 complete. Cover maintained. Faction data acquired. Target Issei Hyoudou is stable and linked. Tonight, \text{MND} must be prioritized for processing the new magical concepts."
🌌 Night 5: Sensory Refinement and Will Stabilization
Ariel returned to the PTD, his mind buzzing with the new reality of the Demonic Auras he'd observed. The raw data needed to be processed and integrated into his combat framework.
8:00 PM – PTD Module 1: The Will Projection Refinement
Ariel bypassed the physical grind momentarily, prioritizing spiritual stability after absorbing the ORC's power signatures. He needed to refine his \text{SPR} and solidify the foundation of his ultimate goal: Authoritative Reality Projection.
> Observer: "Scenario: Existence/Soul Stabilization. Goal: Refine \text{SPR} to 0.75. You must use Soul Calming not just for healing, but to actively smooth the chaotic Demonic Aura data acquired today, turning it into usable energy information."
> 
Ariel entered the Zen Garden. He focused the flow of his \text{SPR} 0.67 like a meticulous current, pushing it into the chaotic data spikes left by Rias and Akeno's auras in his mind. He wasn't trying to fight the energy; he was using his Will to categorize and neutralize the psychological interference it caused.
He stretched his awareness to encompass the entirety of his existence—the soul, the mind, and the physical body—forcing them into perfect, singular harmony, mirroring the Dao's ideal state.
The result was a deep, resonant hum within his core—a profound stability that pushed back against fatigue and mental noise.
> Observer: "Will Projection Refinement complete. Chaos successfully neutralized. \text{SPR} Gain: 0.08. Current \text{SPR}: 0.75. This level allows for a more sustained and focused Presence Projection (Fear Aura), and slightly accelerates passive recovery."
> 
9:30 PM – PTD Module 2: The Bully Module Escalation (Supernatural Threat)
With his mind stabilized, Ariel loaded the escalated tactical module. The goal was to train his newly sharpened senses (\text{MND} 1.6) against threats that defy human physics.
> Observer: "Scenario: Kuoh Campus: Supernatural Threat. This combines the MGS VR/Bully environments with low-level magical hazards. Threat: Three student NPCs, two armed with knives (physical), and one with a slow-moving, visible \text{Demonic Energy} projectile (magical). Goal: Neutralize all three non-lethally using stealth, predicting both the knife twitch and the energy gathering time."
> 
Ariel moved through a simulated school corridor at night. He used the stealth and footwork drilled in the MGS module.
 * Prediction 1 (Physical): He approached the two knife-wielders. Ariel instantly detected the micro-twitch in the leader's wrist 250\text{ ms} before the lunge. He reacted with a swift, non-lethal martial arts takedown, using his full PHY 0.809 efficiency to minimize sound.
 * Prediction 2 (Magical): The third NPC—a student whose eyes glowed faint red (simulating a low-level devil)—began gathering a crimson energy projectile. Ariel used his Sensory/Observation not on the hand, but on the Aura Gathering Time he could now faintly detect with his \text{SPR} 0.75. He mentally calculated the 1.2\text{ second} charging time.
 * The Takedown: Ariel waited until the 1.0\text{ second} mark, giving him maximum reaction time. He executed a sudden Burst Speed and closed the distance, delivering a fast, efficient neck chop to the devil NPC, neutralizing them before the projectile could launch.
> Observer: "Bully Module Escalation successful. Prediction of magical attack initiation time is now stable. This training allows you to use your MND and SPR to treat magic attacks as a slow, readable gathering of energy. Gain: PHY 0.001 (Due to burst speed execution). \text{MND} 0.05 (Processing magical threat data)."
> 
11:00 PM – The Grind Continues
Ariel finished the night with essential upkeep: basic stretching, 50\text{ kg} compound lifts for endurance, and 30 minutes of continuous Soul Calming to prepare his body for the weekend. The process was agonizing, but the mental clarity was worth the pain.
[Current Status Check: PHY 0.81 (Hardening). \text{MND} 1.65 (High Speed Sensor). \text{SPR} 0.75 (Stable Will/Energy). Appearance: Still the friendly, slightly overweight transfer student.]

## 🏋️ Weekend Grind: The Mortal Variable's Ascent
Saturday: The Physical Breakthrough
Ariel dedicated the entire day to the Physical Augmentation module in the PTD, wearing the HRVR (Hyper-Realistic VR) Gravity Module set to 3 \times \text{Earth's gravity}. This was the only way to accelerate the shredding of his soft tissue and build the muscle density necessary for the Silhouette.
PTD Module 1: Gravity Training and The 500\text{ kg} Leap
Ariel was subjected to intense, focused compound lifts while fighting against 3 \text{ Gs} of pressure.
 * The Deadlift Threshold: He executed a series of near-failure attempts on the deadlift. The goal wasn't just to lift the weight, but to force his muscle structure to immediately adapt. He channeled his \text{SPR} 0.75 into his limbs, using Existence/Soul Calming to manage the internal stress.
   * Result: After nine grueling hours of effort, sweat, and simulated muscle tears, Ariel broke through. He executed a shaky, but clean, 500\text{ kg} deadlift against the 3 \text{ Gs} pressure, screaming with effort.
 * Transformation: The Observer Channel confirmed the breakthrough. This singular act of will had forced a massive spike in his core metric. The 1\% soft tissue reduction achieved over the past week was surpassed in this single day.
> Observer: "Physical Augmentation Critical Breakthrough achieved. 500\text{ kg} deadlift capacity stable. The inertia of your past self has been broken. PHY Gain: 0.4 (spike due to extreme stress). \text{MND} usage: 98\%. The external visible transformation is now 5\% of the total required. You have shed significant soft tissue and your core is now steel. You are functionally approaching a peak human athlete."
> 
Ariel's slightly overweight appearance is visibly diminishing; he now looks like a heavily muscled, powerful athlete with a small layer of stubborn, residual fat—the final scar of his regret.
[Current Status Check: PHY 1.209 (Functionally Fit). \text{MND} 1.65. \text{SPR} 0.75.]
Evening: Practical Observation
Ariel, physically exhausted but mentally alert, took a walk near the abandoned factory district of Kuoh. He needed to test his senses against real, ambient supernatural energy.
He used his \text{SPR} 0.75 to tune his awareness. The night felt different—the air wasn't just empty; it was thick with lingering, chaotic energy.
Ariel stopped near a dilapidated warehouse.
He felt a sudden, distinct drop in temperature and a vile, cold Aura Signature—nothing like the clean, regal power of the Gremory peerage. This felt corrupt and desperate.
> Observer: "Warning: Low-level Stray Devil detected. High aggression rating. Stay concealed. This is observation only."
> 
Ariel watched from the shadows. A grotesque, malformed humanoid figure with small, stunted wings hovered near the warehouse. It was moving restlessly, searching.
Ariel used his 1.65 \text{MND} to catalog its movements and power usage. He noticed the Stray Devil's energy signature faltered whenever it made a big movement—a clear tactical weakness.
A second crimson flash arrived—a group of three figures, clearly Rias's peerage, had arrived to deal with the threat. Ariel had observed enough. He turned and retreated silently, leaving the clean-up to the local authority.
Result: Ariel confirmed the existence of hostile threats and acquired raw data on combat strategy, all while maintaining his invisibility.
Sunday: The Mental Refinement
Ariel focused entirely on integrating his new physical strength with his Will Projection.
PTD Module 2: The Will of the Silhouette
Ariel entered the void, channeling his new, massive \text{PHY} 1.209 into his \text{SPR} 0.75. The goal was to force his Will to match his raw physical potential.
> Observer: "Scenario: Presence Projection Upgrade. You must sustain the Fear Aura for one full minute without conscious energy expenditure. Let your Existence do the work."
> 
Ariel forced the projection of his Will. Now, with the bedrock of 500\text{ kg} strength behind it, the projection was instantly denser and colder. It wasn't a flicker; it was a heavy, suffocating Presence—the feeling of the Legendary Heavenly Destroyer (Gosu).
He sustained it for the full minute.
> Observer: "Will Projection refinement successful. \text{SPR} Gain: 0.15. Current \text{SPR}: 0.9. Your Presence is now a passive deterrent to low-level threats and will cause any non-devil human to flee instinctively. This is a crucial step towards the Silhouette."
> 
Evening: Cover Reinforcement
Ariel walked to a convenience store near Issei's home, acting like a normal student buying snacks. He ran into Issei, who was buying his own afternoon junk food.
"Ariel! What's up, man?" Issei greeted him warmly.
"Just fueling up for the week," Ariel replied, offering a friendly, tired smile. Issei didn't notice the new, defined muscle in Ariel's shoulders under his shirt, but he noticed the intensity in Ariel's eyes.
Ariel ensured his cover was stable, and his friendship bond with the target was strengthened.
📈 The Transformation Checkpoint
Ariel has reached \text{PHY} 1.209. He is functionally a peak human athlete.
We will continue the grind during the upcoming school week. The next training session will be detailed when his PHY reaches 1.5—the trigger for the MGS storyline.
The Next Target: \text{PHY} 1.5
Ariel's focus in the PTD will now be on speed and endurance, preparing him for high-stakes infiltration.
The Plot: The Riser Phenex plotline is about to begin. Ariel must now juggle the increasing demands of his physical training with the social obligation of protecting his friend, Issei, during the Rias engagement saga.

## 🎭 Day 6 (Monday): The Holy Girl and the Political Storm
8:00 AM – Kuoh Gates: A Conflicting Aura
Ariel walked through the gates, his body feeling significantly denser and more efficient after the weekend's 500\text{ kg} grind (\text{PHY} 1.209).
His \text{SPR} 0.75 immediately picked up a new, strange energy signature—one he hadn't experienced before. It was pure, warm, and radiant, yet surrounded by an unnatural pall of loneliness and surveillance.
He saw her: Asia Argento. She was dressed in the school uniform, looking incredibly lost and clutching a small teddy bear.
Internal Data (Aura Check): Asia Argento Aura: Holy Power detected. High density, pure, but unstable. Foreign signature detected: Faint, lingering Fallen Angel surveillance nearby. Conclusion: This girl is the source of a major power conflict.
Ariel's natural kindness immediately kicked in. He couldn't ignore someone who looked so utterly lost, especially one radiating a beacon of Holy energy in a place he knew was crawling with devils.
He approached her with his standard friendly, non-threatening demeanor.
"Hey, are you alright?" Ariel asked gently, his smile genuine. "You look a little lost. Are you the new transfer student? I'm Ariel."
Asia looked up, her blue eyes wide with surprise and relief. She had been avoided by everyone else—her Holy Aura subconsciously pushing away the Devils and Devil-aligned humans of Kuoh.
"Oh, hello," Asia replied softly. "Yes, I am. My name is Asia Argento. I'm looking for the faculty office."
"Welcome to Kuoh, Asia," Ariel said warmly, nodding toward the office. "It's right down that main hall. It can be a little confusing at first. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it."
He didn't linger—respecting her space—but his friendly interaction had achieved a vital goal: establishing a positive, protective link and giving her a moment of normalcy in the hostile environment.
Observation Check: As he walked away, Ariel's \text{MND} 1.65 tracked a sudden, subtle shift in the shadows near the clock tower—a fleeting sense of focused observation that confirmed the Fallen Angel surveillance.
The danger is real, and she is a target. I need to be ready.
4:00 PM – The ORC Meeting: The Political Storm
Ariel followed Issei to the ORC room, still maintaining his amiable, slightly out-of-shape cover.
The atmosphere was tense. Rias, Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko were all assembled, radiating stress.
A shimmer of silver energy filled the room, and Grayfia Lucifuge—Rias's maid and the Queen of the Gremory household—materialized. Her aura was terrifying: cold, dense, and absolute.
Internal Data (Aura Check): Grayfia Lucifuge Aura: Ultimate Class Devil. Power: Vast, cold, and perfectly contained. Senses Ariel Caelum Veritas: Registers as less than human; zero demonic or holy power.
Grayfia, radiating authority, began the announcement.
"By the decree of the Four Great Satans, this is an official message regarding the engagement of Rias Gremory to Riser Phenex."
Ariel sat quietly in the back, but his mind was running at 200\%. He used his full \text{MND} and \text{SPR} capacity to catalog every nuance of Grayfia's power and the political shockwaves it generated:
 * The Threat Level: Grayfia's power was several orders of magnitude beyond Raynare. Ariel knew instinctively that his \text{PHY} 1.209 and \text{SPR} 0.75 were not sufficient to confront her or someone of equal rank (like Riser Phenex).
 * Rias's Weakness: Rias's initial anger revealed a deep flaw in her emotional control. This was a tactical opening that Ariel could potentially exploit if he had to intervene later.
 * The Riser Plot: Ariel listened intently to the core information—a Rating Game was coming, forcing Rias into a high-stakes battle against a powerful opponent. The time limit was vague but imminent.
*Ariel understood the assignment: His friend's controller, Rias, was about to be forcibly married off unless his friend, Issei, gained power fast. The time for the 500\text{ kg} deadlift was over. He needed to be ready for combat survival. *
8:00 PM – Monday Night: PTD Training (The Urgency)
Ariel loaded the PTD. He didn't need the Observer Channel to tell him the new goal.
"Loading PTD Scenario: Combat Readiness (PHY 1.5 Target). I need speed, endurance, and agility. I need to be able to fight and survive high-level opponents long enough to run away or create a diversion."
The training session shifted immediately to high-speed drills: explosive sprints, intense agility courses against 2 \text{ Gs}, and long-duration sparring in the MGS VR module—all designed to push his \text{PHY} toward the 1.5 threshold.
Ariel did not stop until he was mentally and physically spent, channeling his focus into the pain, knowing that the safety of his new friends depended on his transformation.

🎬 Resuming Narrative: Day 6 (Monday) - The Correct Path
We pick up right after Ariel meets Asia at the gate. He sensed the Fallen Angel Surveillance.
12:30 PM – Lunchtime: The Warning Signs
Ariel sat on the roof, eating his bento. Issei was there, looking conflicted.
"Everything okay, Issei?" Ariel asked, keeping his tone casual.
Issei sighed. "I met that girl, Asia, again. She's... really nice. But she's a nun. And I'm a... you know." (He gestured vaguely, referring to being a Devil). "My head hurts just getting close to the church."
Ariel nodded, his internal Energy Sensing active. "Just be careful, man. Sometimes nice people get used by bad crowds. If she asks you to go anywhere weird... maybe tell your club president first?"
Ariel planted the seed of caution.
4:00 PM – After School: The Trap
Ariel, feigning a need to buy groceries, tracked Issei and Asia from a distance (100\text{ meters}). His MND 1.65 allowed him to filter the crowd noise and focus on their aura signatures.
He watched them enter a park. He watched Asia heal a scraped knee on a child, her Twilight Healing flashing green.
Internal Data: Twilight Healing confirmed. High-value Sacred Gear. This is why they want her.
Then, he felt it. The familiar, corrupted signature of Raynare.
Ariel hid in an alleyway as Raynare (disguised) approached them. He saw the coercion. He saw Asia leaving with Raynare, looking terrified but resigned.
Ariel clenched his fist. He couldn't attack Raynare here—too many witnesses, and Issei was powerless to stop it yet. The "Kidnapping/Extraction" plot was in motion.
Mission Update: The Church Battle is imminent.

## 🗓️ Day 7 (Tuesday): Infiltration Preparation
Ariel spent his Tuesday maintaining his cover while dedicating his mental energy to tactical preparation.
8:00 AM – Kuoh Academy: Reinforcing the Cover
Ariel maintained his routine: friendly greetings, especially to Issei and Asia.
He approached Asia at lunchtime, finding her alone and looking visibly anxious.
"Hey, Asia. I saw you yesterday, and you looked like you were in a hurry," Ariel said with a kind, reassuring smile, offering her a packaged pastry. "Just wanted to make sure you're doing okay."
Asia's eyes lit up. "Oh, Ariel-kun! Thank you. I was... helping a friend. I'm fine now."
Ariel nodded, letting the conversation remain casual. He used his \text{MND} 1.65 to sense the Fallen Angel surveillance again. They were closer today, more confident—focused on Asia and the inevitable extraction.
"Good. Look, if you ever feel uncomfortable, or if anyone pressures you into doing something you don't like, please tell me or your new friends in the Occult Research Club, okay?" Ariel urged, his voice conveying only genuine, friendly concern.
Asia gave him a heartfelt nod, visibly touched by his kindness. Cover and Protection Alert established.
4:00 PM – After School: Tactical Reconnaissance
Instead of going straight home, Ariel used his enhanced physical efficiency (\text{PHY} 1.209) to jog to the abandoned church location. He maintained the casual pace of an overweight runner struggling through a mild workout, masking his true speed.
He approached the church from the hidden forest path, using his Sensory/Observation to map the layout:
 * Aura Signature Mapping: He detected deep, powerful, lingering Holy and Demonic residue, but also fresh, repulsive traces of Fallen Angel power—confirming the hideout location.
 * Physical Observation: He cataloged entry points, potential blind spots, and the structural integrity of the old building. A church, high ceilings, lots of cover, but terrible acoustics—sound suppression will be vital.
He knew the raid would happen tonight or tomorrow. He needed to train for stealth and magic nullification immediately.
🌃 Night 7 (Tuesday): Nullification and Shadow Training
Ariel loaded the PTD with specific scenarios designed to counter the Fallen Angel threat (light spears and ambush tactics).
PTD Module 1: Infiltration and Shadow Work (MGS VR)
Ariel loaded the MGS VR module, but added a constraint: he was surrounded by ambient noise and the enemy had 10\% better peripheral vision.
> Observer: "Scenario: Silent Infiltration (Church Module). Goal: Execute non-lethal takedowns on six moving targets in a low-light, high-echo environment. Must achieve zero sound-bleed and zero visual detection."
> 
Ariel focused not on speed, but on fluidity and silence. He used his slightly heavier body's momentum to execute zero-sound landings and controlled, quick pressure points—all movements designed to silence an enemy instantly without a fight. His \text{MND} 1.65 filtered out the virtual noise, allowing him to perceive only the enemy's breathing and footsteps.
 * Result: He achieved the goal with 95\% efficiency. His body was now trained to move like a shadow, despite its size.
PTD Module 2: Will Projection vs. Magic (Nullification Intent)
This was the critical training to survive a Light Spear. Ariel knew he couldn't dodge them all, nor could he physically tank them. He needed a way to use his Will to interfere with the energy itself.
> Observer: "Scenario: Magical Counter-Intent (Logia Type Simulation). Threat: Holograms of low-level \text{Fallen Angels} firing light spears, and high-level \text{Logia Type} attacks (pure energy flow). Goal: Do not dodge. Use Will Projection (\text{SPR} 0.9) to impose an absolute state of Nullification on the incoming energy flow."
> 
Ariel stood still as the light spears launched. He didn't try to stop them with force. He focused his mind on the essence of the incoming energy (the Logia/Light Spear) and commanded its inherent nature to cease its flow using pure Will.
The first spear hit his shoulder, inflicting a simulated burn.
The second spear struck, and Ariel focused his entire being on the Intent of Nullification. He decreed that the Holy energy could not proceed.
The light spear flickered and dissipated 10\text{ cm} from his chest, harmlessly dissolving into the air.
> Observer: "Magical Counter-Intent successful! You achieved momentary Nullification Intent. This is not resistance; it is Willful Energy Dissipation. \text{SPR} usage: 99\%. This technique is effective against low-level energy constructs but will fully exhaust your \text{SPR} reserves. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.05."
> 
10:30 PM – Training Conclusion
Ariel finished the night with recovery and endurance drills, ready for the inevitable conflict. He could now move silently and negate a single low-level magic attack.
[Current Status Check: PHY 1.209 (Hardening). \text{MND} 1.65 (Sensor). \text{SPR} 0.95 (Magic Nullifier).]

## 🗓️ Day 8 (Wednesday): Final Warning and Tactical Deployment
1. Wednesday Morning: The Final Social Warning (Option 2)
Ariel knew the kidnapping would happen tonight. He could not, in good conscience, let it happen without attempting to alert his friends. He had to rely on his \text{MND} for influence and his friendly, concerned cover.
He found Rias Gremory alone in the hallway before the morning bell, radiating a focused, powerful \text{Demonic Aura} as she prepared for the day.
Ariel approached her with a worried, yet respectful, demeanor.
"Sitri-kaichou—I mean, Gremory-kaichou," Ariel corrected himself, feigning social awkwardness. "I know this is going to sound crazy, but I feel like I need to say something."
Rias stopped, her emerald eyes narrowing slightly at the unremarkable transfer student. "What is it, Ariel-kun?"
Ariel leaned in slightly, keeping his voice low and serious. "It's about Asia Argento. She's incredibly kind, and she has this... good energy that stands out. But I've seen some weird people watching her around town. They don't look like they mean well."
He used his \text{MND} 1.65 to focus his words—not with Will Projection, but with pure, persuasive sincerity.
"I just have a really bad feeling about her. If she goes off with anyone she doesn't know, or if she asks Issei to go somewhere weird, you need to find her fast. I think someone is going to try and hurt her tonight."
Rias stared at him, completely unable to sense the terrifying power beneath his average exterior. She only saw the concerned, slightly overweight student appealing to her superior judgment.
"I appreciate your concern, Ariel-kun," Rias said, her tone professional but dismissive. "I will keep an eye on things. Kuoh is safe under my protection."
Ariel nodded, accepting the dismissal. "Okay. That's all I wanted to say. Sorry to bother you." He walked away, satisfied that he had done his part. The burden of proof now falls on them. My role shifts to tactical support.
2. Wednesday Night: The Church Battle (Option 1 - Tactical Insertion)
Ariel waited until the atmosphere turned frantic. Around 10\text{ PM}, his \text{SPR} 0.95 went wild: a sudden, powerful surge of Demonic Aura (Rias and Akeno moving fast) followed by the hideous, chaotic signature of the Fallen Angels and the terrifying signature of Freed Sellzen (the corrupted Priest).
He knew the ORC was mobilizing for the church raid.
Ariel moved out, not to fight, but to provide support and stabilization—the role of the Mortal Variable. He used his enhanced \text{PHY} 1.209 to travel silently to the abandoned church, approaching from the hidden forest path he scouted yesterday.
Infiltration and Shadow Work
He used his Stealth Training to slip past the main entrance, where Rias and her group would engage. He navigated the shadows of the old church, feeling the oppressive weight of the Holy and Fallen Angel energy.
He reached the upper rafters, providing a perfect, concealed observation point over the main sanctuary where the Fallen Angels (Raynare, Mittelt, Kalawarner, Dohnaseek) and Freed Sellzen were executing the ritual to extract Asia's Sacred Gear.
He saw Issei and the ORC Peerage burst in. The chaos was immediate.
The Intervention: Nullifying the Threat
Ariel did not interfere with Issei's main conflict with Raynare, as that was necessary for his growth. Ariel focused on the peripheral threats—the lesser Fallen Angels and the erratic Freed Sellzen.
Freed Sellzen, wielding his corrupted holy sword, laughed maniacally and charged at Kiba, forcing the Devil Knight onto the defensive. Mittelt and Kalawarner launched a barrage of light spears at the Peerage.
A spear aimed at a distracted Koneko—who was trying to shield Issei—flew straight toward her blind spot.
Ariel acted.
He unleashed his full Will Projection (\text{SPR} 0.95) focused entirely on the single light spear. He did not move a muscle. He simply commanded the energy's flow to stop.
The light spear flickered and dissolved into harmless particles 10\text{ cm} from Koneko's head, leaving no trace.
Koneko paused, feeling the sudden, inexplicable void where the attack should have been. She glanced around, sensing nothing.
Ariel's move was successful. He neutralized a threat without revealing himself, preserving the timeline.
The Retreat
As the battle raged, Ariel continued his surveillance. He used his \text{MND} to predict the trajectories of the light spears, mentally identifying the moments when the Peerage was truly vulnerable.
 * Issei's Awakening: Ariel observed the moment Issei triggered the first hint of his Boosted Gear's true power, the sheer force of the red Aura overwhelming the space.
 * Raynare's Defeat: Ariel watched the fight conclude, ensuring Raynare did not escape this time.
Once the main conflict was over and Rias prepared the ritual to revive Asia, Ariel used his practiced Stealth to melt into the shadows and exit the church completely undetected, leaving the grieving and healing process to the Peerage.
He had saved Asia's life (via stabilization) and the lives of the Peerage (via nullification), all while remaining the unremarkable, slightly overweight friend in the shadows.
🏋️ Wednesday Night PTD: The Final Push
Ariel was mentally exhausted. His single act of Nullification Intent had drained his \text{SPR} 0.95 completely.
He loaded the PTD. He didn't need meditation; he needed to hit the final physical threshold.
> Observer: "Ariel, your intervention was critical. However, your SPR is depleted. Your PHY must now be prioritized. The Riser Phenex threat is imminent. Target: PHY 1.5 for high-intensity, sustained combat survival."
> 
Ariel spent the next five hours in a final, brutal cycle of high-gravity, high-resistance training. He pushed his mind and body to the absolute limit, fueled by the image of Freed Sellzen's psychotic grin and the crushing power of the Fallen Angels.
He forced his body to adapt, using the stored energy and fat reserves from his past self as fuel for the final transformation.
The result was a violent, rapid adaptation.
> Observer: "Final Threshold breached. Physical Augmentation complete. \text{PHY} Gain: 0.291. Current \text{PHY}: 1.5 (Functionally Fit)."
> 
🎉 Transformation Checkpoint: \text{PHY} 1.5 Reached!
Ariel stepped out of the PTD. He was no longer the slightly overweight transfer student. He was fit, lean, and incredibly dense. The residual fat (the scar of his regret) was finally gone, replaced by hard, efficient muscle. His appearance was now that of a handsome, peak human athlete with a quiet intensity in his eyes. He had earned his Silhouette physique.
[Current Status Check: PHY 1.5 (Combat Ready). \text{MND} 1.65 (High Speed Sensor). \text{SPR} 0.0 (Exhausted, needs recovery).]
> Observer: "Ariel, you have reached the physical requirements for sustained high-intensity combat. The Metal Gear Solid VR Training Scenario is now fully unlocked. We can now transition to complex combat and infiltration storylines."
> 

## 🗓️ Day 9 (Thursday): The Earned Physique
We begin the first revelation—the dramatic change in Ariel's appearance after achieving \text{PHY} 1.5.
8:00 AM – Kuoh Academy: The Double Take
Ariel walked into Kuoh Academy. He felt lighter, faster, and infinitely more efficient. His clothes fit perfectly over a lean, muscular frame that radiated the coiled tension of a trained athlete. He had the Silhouette physique—handsome, athletic, and unremarkable only because of his naturally friendly, unassuming demeanor.
The change was immediate and undeniable.
He walked past the gate and spotted Issei and the newly revived Asia Argento, who was now officially enrolling as a student.
Ariel approached them with his usual warm, friendly smile.
"Morning, you two! Looks like we've got a busy day ahead," Ariel greeted them.
Issei stared. His mouth dropped slightly, forgetting his fatigue from the previous night's trauma.
"A-Ariel? Is that... you?" Issei stammered, looking him up and down. "Dude, what happened? Did you just... get fit?"
Asia, the kindest and most innocent observer, simply looked relieved. "Oh, Ariel-kun! You look much healthier! That's wonderful!"
Ariel chuckled, playing his cover perfectly. "Thanks, Issei. Yeah, I just decided to stop thinking about it and actually hit the gym hard over the last few days. Turns out my old habits were weighing me down—literally. The pain was brutal, but worth it."
He used the word "pain" to subtly reference his PTD training, keeping the cover relatable to a normal human's struggle.
Impact Check: Success. The ORC now sees Ariel as intensely focused and driven, validating his strange physical excellence without needing a supernatural explanation.
4:00 PM – The ORC Clubroom: Unsettling the Queen
Ariel followed Issei to the ORC after school. He sat in his usual spot, observing the Peerage.
Rias and Akeno were already present. Rias looked at Ariel, and her eyes, trained to analyze the subtleties of power, narrowed.
"Ariel-kun," Rias began, her voice cold and analytical. "You seem... transformed."
Ariel maintained his open, friendly posture. "Thank you, Gremory-kaichou. Just focusing on martial arts training. I realized if I'm going to keep up with my studies, I need to stay sharp physically, too."
Rias’s Internal Assessment: The speed of his transformation defied normal human physiology, but he still registered zero power. It was physically efficient, but magically inert. This paradox was deeply unsettling to her, but she had no evidence to classify him as a threat.
Kiba Yuuto, the most observant martial artist, gave Ariel a slow, appreciative nod. "Your posture is different, Ariel-kun. More stable. You look like you've found your center."
Ariel offered Kiba a genuine, knowing smile—a subtle, friendly connection based on shared physical effort. "Thank you, Yuuto-kun. It was a long week."
5:00 PM – The Political Bomb
Just as Rias was about to update the Peerage on Asia's recruitment, the silver shimmer of the Ultimate Class Devil appeared: Grayfia Lucifuge (who, in this corrected timeline, is now visiting post-Asia revival).
Grayfia’s presence was the same as before: cold, absolute, and overwhelming.
She announced the engagement to Riser Phenex and the forthcoming Rating Game. The tension in the room skyrocketed.
Ariel observed the scene, his \text{MND} 1.65 cataloging the political fallout:
 * Riser Threat: Grayfia's words established the sheer power of Riser Phenex—a high-class devil with immortality. Ariel knew his \text{PHY} 1.5 was not enough to fight Riser; he needed infiltration and tactical genius.
 * The ORC's Resolve: He observed the despair on Rias's face and the fierce, but inadequate, resolve of Issei.
Ariel now had the motivation and the timeline for his next phase of training.

## 1. Thursday Night: The First MGS VR Training Session (Night 9)
With his \text{PHY} now at 1.5, Ariel could sustain the most demanding and complex simulation in the PTD: the full-scale Metal Gear Solid (MGS) VR Scenario. His training was now about converting raw strength into strategic excellence.
PTD Module: Shadow Moses Island - Infiltration
Ariel loaded the VR. The environment was a vast, cold, realistic military base filled with enemy soldiers, security cameras, and advanced weaponry.
> Observer: "Scenario: Sustained Tactical Infiltration. Target: Rescue an asset (Meryl). Focus: Stealth and Resource Management. You must remain undetected for the duration of the mission. No fatal takedowns. This simulation requires 8 hours of continuous \text{PHY}, \text{MND}, and \text{SPR} usage."
> 
Ariel's goals were specific and non-traditional:
 * Mastering the CQC Takedown: Using his \text{PHY} 1.5 for rapid, precise, non-lethal strikes (knuckle taps, pressure points) that rendered guards instantly unconscious without sound.
 * Sensory Overdrive: Using his \text{MND} 1.65 to predict guard patrol changes, camera sweeps, and acoustic blind spots.
 * Endurance: Sustaining a high-stress, low-movement stealth state for eight consecutive hours—a requirement for infiltrating Riser's home field during the Rating Game.
Ariel moved through the scenario as the ultimate stealth operative. His new body felt like a finely tuned instrument. He utilized his Burst Speed only for crucial transitions, otherwise moving with the slow, deliberate grace of a predator. He was quiet, efficient, and utilized the environment perfectly.
He spent the next eight hours in a state of hyper-awareness, successfully completing the mission without detection.
> Observer: "MGS VR Infiltration successful. Stealth rating: 100\%. \text{PHY} 1.5 endurance stable. \text{MND} usage optimal. This scenario is now the baseline for all subsequent combat training, forcing the integration of all metrics. Gain: Minor, holistic improvements across all stats."
> 
Ariel exited the PTD, physically exhausted but mentally primed for the next day. The urgency of the Riser threat had instilled a new, higher baseline of performance.
2. Friday Afternoon: The Tactical Insight Reveal (Day 10)
This is the start of Phase 2 of Ariel's revelation strategy, where he leverages his \text{MND} 1.65 (High Speed Sensor) to appear as a peerless strategist—The Tactical Insight.
The ORC Training Ground: Disarray
Ariel joined Issei at the ORC meeting. Rias, under the pressure of the Riser engagement, was forcing the Peerage into intense training immediately. She was explaining the basic rules of the Rating Game—a strategic territory battle.
Kiba, Koneko, and Akeno were sparring, trying to refine their coordinated tactics, but they were disjointed and clearly stressed. Issei, newly revived, was struggling just to control his \text{Boosted Gear}'s 10-second limit.
Ariel watched silently from the side, a new, physically fit presence in the room. He ran his \text{MND} 1.65 on the entire scene, observing every flaw:
 * Kiba: Moving with 15\% wasted movement in his footwork—a flaw of speed over economy.
 * Akeno: Her magic setup time was too long (a 2.5\text{ second} delay before a major lightning strike), leaving her vulnerable.
 * Rias: Her positioning as Queen was too forward, relying on raw power rather than strategic reserve.
The Interruption: The Flawless Read
Rias, frustrated with the lack of progress, called a halt to the training.
Ariel decided this was the moment. He approached Rias with an open, friendly demeanor, maintaining his cover as an interested observer.
"Gremory-kaichou, I know I'm just watching, but if you're planning a territory game, I might have spotted a few bottlenecks in the formation," Ariel offered casually.
Rias looked at him, annoyed by the interruption but intrigued by his focused stare. "Ariel-kun, this is a Devil's Rating Game. It's about power, not human strategy."
"It's about chess, right? And protecting the King," Ariel countered gently. "Right now, your Queen is sacrificing her position."
Ariel quickly drew a formation diagram on a spare notepad .
"In a team fight, Kiba-kun is your Knight—he should be used to exploit micro-gaps and distract the Bishop/Rook line," Ariel explained, his voice calm and precise. "But he's moving 15\% too much, wasting energy on unnecessary pivots. He needs to move like a straight line, exploiting his superior speed for economy."
He turned to the silent Koneko. "And Toujou-san is the Rook. You're strong, but you're shielding Issei-kun when you should be holding ground. You need to anchor a defensible position, not drift. Also, your left stance is vulnerable to a counter-grapple."
Koneko's eyes widened fractionally. She had been working on that stance flaw in secret.
Ariel finished by looking at Rias. "And you, Kaichou. A Queen should not be in the vanguard unless it's the end game. You're the engine. You need Akeno-san to cover your retreat, but her magic takes too long to charge. You need to use her as the opening move, not the defensive counter."
The Aftermath: Phase 2 Complete
The entire Peerage was silent. Ariel's analysis was flawless, immediate, and high-level, utilizing military, martial arts, and strategic concepts that shouldn't come from a normal high school student.
Rias's \text{MND} registered the impact: The logic is undeniable. The analysis is precise. But... how does he know this?
Rias conceded, slightly shaken. "Thank you, Ariel-kun. That was... insightful."
Akeno giggled, her dangerous violet aura settling into appreciation. "Ara ara, Ariel-kun, you're quite the genius! We'll use your advice."
Ariel smiled, successfully completing Phase 2 of his plan. He had established himself as the Tactical Strategist—someone whose mind was useful, but whose power was still unquantifiable.
[The Riser Rating Game training is now under Ariel's indirect guidance, setting the stage for his most critical intervention during the battle.]

## 🌃 Night 10 (Friday): The Tri-Focus Training
Ariel loaded the PTD, channeling the pressure from the Riser engagement announcement into focused discipline.
1. MGS VR Intensive: Sustained CQC and Stealth (Option 1)
Ariel loaded the MGS VR scenario again, pushing for flawless execution with his \text{PHY} 1.5 body.
> Observer: "Scenario: Big Boss Rank Criteria. Target: Achieve zero alerts, zero kills, and 100\% efficiency in CQC takedowns across a medium-sized zone. Focus: Sustained CQC application against moving targets."
> 
Ariel spent two hours perfecting the non-lethal, high-speed takedowns. The key was minimizing movement and sound. He practiced CQC chains—disarming, striking, and restraining two enemies simultaneously in complete silence.
 * Result: Ariel's \text{PHY} 1.5 adapted rapidly, achieving flawless CQC takedowns. He did not achieve the Big Boss Rank on the first night (as it requires sustained mastery), but his core efficiency was cemented. Gain: Minor \text{PHY} optimization.
2. Spiritual Refinement: Stabilizing Nullification Intent (Option 2)
Ariel immediately followed the intense physical stress with a dedicated focus on his Spiritual Capacity (\text{SPR} 0.95) to prepare the Nullification Intent for the Riser scenario.
> Observer: "Scenario: SPR Stabilization. Target: Sustain the low-level Nullification Intent for one minute without full depletion. Current \text{SPR} usage for a single burst is 99\%; this must be reduced."
> 
Ariel entered the Zen Garden and used Existence/Soul Calming. He didn't focus on stopping energy, but on maintaining a state of neutrality around his body, visualizing the \text{SPR} field constantly pushing for zero change.
He succeeded in maintaining the neutral field for 45 seconds before the reserve drained. This prolonged use forced his spiritual reserves to adapt.
 * Result: The spiritual pathway strengthened, allowing for more controlled application. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.05 (stabilization). Current \text{SPR}: 1.0. Ariel has reached the threshold where his Will Projection is now a sustainable, low-level passive deterrent!
3. Anime Battle Simulation: Logia Type Stress Test (Option 3)
With his \text{SPR} at the critical 1.0 threshold, Ariel loaded a specialized module designed to stress-test his Nullification Intent against continuous energy flow, a vital skill for surviving powerful magic users.
> Observer: "Scenario: Logia Type Resistance. Threat: A single holographic opponent with the Fire-Fire Logia ability (Ace/Akainu-level), projecting continuous, high-temperature energy flow. Goal: Do not defeat the opponent. Sustain your Nullification Intent against the heat/fire flow for 10 seconds. Failure will result in severe simulated burn damage."
> 
Ariel was placed in a simulated environment as the Logia Type user unleashed a continuous stream of fire. Ariel focused his \text{SPR} 1.0 into his Nullification Intent.
He mentally decreed that the fire's energy state could not exist within 1\text{ metre} of his body. The pressure was immense.
The fire stream hit the invisible wall of his Will. It didn't bounce off; it simply flickered, sputtered, and turned into harmless smoke 1\text{ cm} from his skin. He sustained the drain for 10 seconds, his entire body screaming from the mental effort.
 * Result: The simulation confirmed Ariel's ability to interfere with continuous, high-level energy flows using pure Will. This technique is now validated for use against Riser's fire attacks and high-level Demonic Power. Gain: \text{MND} + 0.05 (processing continuous energy interaction).
🌟 Training Summary and Next Steps
Ariel has successfully reached and stabilized the critical \text{SPR} 1.0 threshold, validating his Nullification Intent against major energy threats. He is now ready for the Riser Rating Game.
Current Status Check:
 * PHY: 1.5 (CQC Master / Peak Human)
 * MND: 1.7 (High Speed Sensor / Tactical Genius)
 * SPR: 1.0 (Stable Nullification / Passive Presence)
Next Move: The focus shifts entirely to Phase 2—displaying his tactical genius during the ORC's training, followed by the inevitable clash with Riser Phenex.
We will now proceed with the chronological narrative.

## 📅 Weekend Grind: Refining the Sentinel
Ariel used the weekend to consolidate his new \text{PHY} 1.5 strength and stabilize his \text{SPR} 1.0 Nullification Intent, preparing for the intense demands of the Rating Game and the tactical application of his genius (Phase 2).
Saturday: PTD Intensive - Pushing for Big Boss Rank (Option 1)
Ariel dedicated the bulk of the day to the PTD, focusing on pushing his stealth and endurance to the expert level required for the Big Boss Rank.
PTD Module 1: MGS VR - Endurance and Efficiency
Ariel loaded a complex MGS scenario—a larger map with patrolling attack dogs and thermal cameras, forcing him to integrate his CQC, Burst Speed, and Stealth into a sustained eight-hour mission.
> Observer: "Scenario: Big Boss Rank Progression. Target: Sustain 99.9\% efficiency for eight hours (zero alerts, zero kills). Focus: Endurance and adapting to non-human sensors."
> 
Ariel spent the session mastering the rhythm of stealth, using his \text{MND} 1.7 to anticipate the thermal camera sweep and the acoustic profile of the dogs' breathing. His \text{PHY} 1.5 allowed him to hold uncomfortable, perfectly still positions for extended periods.
 * Result: Ariel successfully completed the mission, achieving an A-Rank (one step below Big Boss). He had mastered the core mechanics but needed more exposure to unexpected variables. Gain: Minor \text{PHY} and \text{MND} optimization.
PTD Module 2: Anime Battle Simulation - Scaling up Nullification
Ariel immediately followed the MGS session with a more intense spiritual stress test, focusing on sustaining the Nullification Intent against a powerful, continuous attack.
> Observer: "Scenario: Continuous Energy Resistance. Threat: A sustained, close-range attack from a character using Lightning Type Magic (Akeno/Laxus level). Goal: Hold Nullification Intent for 3 consecutive seconds without full \text{SPR} depletion."
> 
Ariel focused his \text{SPR} 1.0 against the intense, electrical flow. The simulated pressure was agonizing, but the technique held. The lightning stream fizzled out around him, leaving only static electricity. He achieved the 3\text{ second} hold, forcing his spiritual capacity to expand under extreme duress.
 * Result: Confirmed sustainable interference against powerful magic. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.1 (Stress Adaptation). Current \text{SPR}: 1.1.
Sunday: Practical Observation - Riser's Arrival (Option 2)
Ariel devoted Sunday evening to external surveillance. He knew Riser Phenex, being a major noble, would likely make a show of force upon arriving in Kuoh for the initial meeting with Rias.
Ariel patrolled the outskirts of Kuoh in his new, physically fit guise, using his \text{SPR} 1.1 to scan for powerful, high-class Demonic Aura.
Around 7:00 PM, near a large, expensive downtown hotel, he felt it.
The air became thick and heavy—not with the gentle power of the Gremory peerage, but with a hot, arrogant, overwhelming Demonic Aura mixed with the distinct, metallic scent of Fire Magic.
> Observer: "Warning: High-Class Devil signature detected. Primary target signature: Riser Phenex. Secondary signatures (Peerage) detected. Stay concealed. This is observation only."
> 
Ariel watched from a safe distance as a flamboyant limousine arrived at the hotel. Out stepped Riser Phenex—immaculately dressed, radiating casual power and immense ego. His peerage followed, beautiful and powerful.
Ariel didn't focus on their faces; he focused his \text{MND} 1.7 on their Aura Footprints and Tactical Deployment:
 * Riser's Fire Aura: His fire magic was immediate, potent, and deeply intertwined with his existence (confirming the immortality/regeneration claim).
 * Rook and Knight Analysis: Riser's Rook and Knight were incredibly dense and powerful, confirming the need for Ariel's tactical advice (Phase 2) to counter them.
Ariel had observed the enemy firsthand. The threat was real, arrogant, and terrifyingly powerful.
He retreated, his resolve hardened. The disparity between his power and Riser's was vast, confirming the necessity of infiltration and strategic defense over direct confrontation.
📈 Status and Next Step
Ariel is now spiritually potent (\text{SPR} 1.1) and tactically brilliant (\text{MND} 1.7). He is ready to execute Phase 2 (The Tactical Insight) during the ORC's training.
Current Status Check:
 * PHY: 1.5
 * MND: 1.7
 * SPR: 1.1

## ## Chapter 7 – Revised & Expanded: The Day Riser Phenex Learned Fear Tastes Like Strawberry Taiyaki

Occult Research Clubroom – Thursday, 3:28 p.m.

The flaming circle spat out Riser and his entire harem exactly as canon intended.

Riser strutted forward, arms wide.

“Rias, my beloved fiancée! Time to stop playing with trash and come home to a real man.”

Issei’s fists clenched so hard the Boosted Gear sparked.

Riser noticed, smirked, and decided to twist the knife exactly like the original script.

“Look at this pathetic Pawn. Dreaming of being Harem King?”  
He snapped his fingers. His entire peerage pressed against him in a wave of perfume and barely-there clothing.

“This is what a real harem looks like, pervert.”

He yanked his Queen, Yubelluna, forward and kissed her hard, one hand sliding down to grope her openly in front of everyone.

Issei’s face went from red to purple.  
Veins popped. Boosted Gear roared.

Riser pulled away from the kiss with a smug chuckle.

“See? This is power. This is status. You’ll never—”

## Chapter 7 – The Day Riser Phenex Choked on Nothing
Occult Research Clubroom – Monday, 3:35 p.m.
The magic circle on the floor roared like a blast furnace.
Riser Phenex emerged, radiating heat and arrogance in equal measure. He wore a white suit that cost more than Issei’s house and a smirk that begged to be punched.
Behind him stood his peerage—fifteen beautiful women, all dressed in revealing outfits, all radiating High-Class Devil power.
Riser spread his arms, ignoring everyone except Rias.
"Rias, my beloved! I've come to save you from this dreary little human school. Come, the Underworld awaits."
Issei stepped forward, his Boosted Gear manifesting with a green flash.
"She doesn't want to go with you, fried chicken!"
Riser blinked, looking at Issei like he was a stain on the carpet.
"A Low-Class Pawn? Speaking to me?"
He snapped his fingers.
Yubelluna (his Queen) stepped forward. Riser grabbed her waist roughly, pulling her flush against him, and kissed her deep and hard, making a show of it. He groped her openly, staring Issei dead in the eyes.
"You see this, Pawn? This is the privilege of the high-born. I take what I want. You? You're just... noise."
Issei trembled. The Boosted Gear glowed dangerously bright.
"BOOST!"
The heat in the room spiked. Riser’s aura flared—a suffocating wave of Fire Magic that filled the room, pressing down on everyone. Asia whimpered, shrinking back. Koneko braced herself. Even Rias looked strained under the pressure of an Ultimate-Class family's power.
Except for one person.
Sitting on the far windowsill, munching on a custard taiyaki, was Ariel Caelum Veritas.
He wasn't radiating power. He wasn't glowing.
He was just... eating.
Riser noticed the lack of reaction. It annoyed him.
"And you? Another pet human? Kneel before your betters."
Riser flared his aura harder, sending a concentrated wave of Heat and Fear directly at Ariel. It was enough to make a normal human pass out instantly.
Ariel finished his chew. Swallowed.
He looked at the invisible wall of demonic pressure rushing toward him.
Internal Data: Threat: High-Class Pressure. Source: Magic. Solution: Nullification Intent.
Ariel didn't blink. He didn't flinch.
He simply Projected his Will (SPR 1.1).
“No.”
It wasn't a spoken word. It was a concept. A command.
The wave of heat hit Ariel—and vanished.
It didn't bounce. It didn't explode. It just ceased to exist within one meter of his body.
Riser’s smirk faltered.
"What...?"
Ariel hopped off the windowsill. He walked across the room.
He moved through the suffocating demonic pressure like he was walking through a light breeze. Every step he took, the air around him cleared, the heat dying instantly against his Nullification Intent.
He stopped between Issei and Riser.
He looked exactly like what he was: a fit, handsome, but completely human teenager in a school uniform.
"You're ruining the mood," Ariel said. His voice was calm, friendly, and utterly terrifying because it carried zero magical weight. "And you're scaring the new girl."
He pointed a thumb back at Asia, who was shaking.
Riser’s eyes narrowed. He sensed zero power from Ariel. No Sacred Gear. No magic. Nothing.
"You... you dare walk in my presence, monkey? I'll turn you to ash."
Riser raised a hand. A ball of concentrated Hellfire formed—hot enough to melt steel. He threw it casually at Ariel’s face.
Rias screamed. "Ariel, move!"
Ariel didn't move.
He looked at the fire.
He focused his MND 1.7 on the energy structure. He slammed his SPR 1.1 against it.
[Command: Cease.]
The fireball hit Ariel's personal space—and puff. It dissolved into grey smoke.
Not a single ember touched him.
The room went dead silent.
Yubelluna’s eyes widened.
Rias covered her mouth.
Riser stared at his own hand, then at Ariel.
"You... what did you do? That was Hellfire!"
Ariel smiled—that friendly, easy-going smile that Issei knew.
"I just decided not to burn. It’s a mindset thing."
He turned his back on the High-Class Devil (a move of absolute disrespect) and put a hand on Issei’s shoulder.
"Issei. He's strong, but he relies on the system giving him permission to win. You don't need permission."
Ariel looked back at Riser, his eyes hardening into the Silhouette—cold, unreadable, and deep.
"If you want to fight him, do it properly. A duel.
But if you try to burn my friends outside of the rules again..."
Ariel let his Presence (Will Projection) leak out for just a fraction of a second. It wasn't magical power. It was the sensation of a Predator staring at prey.
"...I'll have to get involved. And I'm not as nice as Rias."
Riser felt a chill crawl up his immortal spine. It made no sense. This boy was a insect. A nothing.
So why did his instincts just scream RUN?
Riser scoffed, masking his confusion with laughter.
"Hah! A duel? Fine! If it shuts up these insects.
I challenge you, Hyoudou Issei. Ten days. A Rating Game.
If I win, Rias is mine. If you win... well, you won't."
He snapped his fingers, stepping back into the magic circle.
But before he vanished, he glared at Ariel.
"I don't know what kind of trick you used, human. But next time, I won't miss."
Ariel waved cheerfully.
"Bye-bye! Drive safe!"
The fire vanished. Riser was gone.
Issei collapsed to his knees, breathing hard.
"Dude... Ariel... you just... you just slapped away a fireball like it was a fly."
Rias walked up to Ariel, grabbing his shoulders. Her eyes were wide, searching his face.
"Ariel. Tell me the truth. What are you?"
Ariel looked at her, then at Issei, then at Asia.
He shrugged, the tension leaving his body as he returned to his "Friendly Friend" persona.
"I'm Ariel Caelum Veritas.
I exercise. I eat well. And I really, really hate bullies."
🚦 Narrative Checkpoint
Current Status:
 * Ariel: Has revealed Phase 3 (Partial Nullification) to the Peerage. He is now an "Anomaly."
 * The Plot: The Rating Game is set. The 10-Day Training Camp begins tomorrow.
 * The Dynamic: Rias and the others now know Ariel is useful against magic, but they still think he's "human" (which is true). They will likely ask him to join the training camp.
Next Step:
We move to the Training Camp in the Mountains. This is where Ariel executes Phase 2 (Tactical Insight) fully, helping Kiba, Koneko, and Issei refine their skills while he secretly trains for the big game.

## ⛰️ Day 12 (Tuesday): Journey to the Training Camp
The confrontation with Riser had been scheduled for ten days later. The ORC mobilized immediately, planning to use the Gremory family's mountain training facility for intensive preparation.
8:00 AM – The Peerage's Ride
Ariel met Issei outside the school. He was carrying a single, efficient backpack that looked too small for a ten-day trip. Rias had requested he join them, a clear attempt to keep the "Mortal Variable" under observation.
The peerage (Rias, Akeno, Kiba, Koneko, Issei, and Asia) was waiting by a large, ornate black sedan that shimmered faintly with Demonic power.
Rias looked Ariel up and down, still trying to reconcile his zero magical presence with his actions yesterday.
"Ariel-kun," Rias said, her voice formal. "Since you have offered such insightful strategic advice, I am formally inviting you to observe our training. However, this is a dangerous location. You will follow every instruction."
Ariel gave her a sincere, friendly smile. "Of course, Kaichou. I'm just here to help my friends. I won't cause any trouble."
He slipped into the car next to Issei and Asia.
 * Issei: "Dude, seriously, how'd you do that? The fire just blinked out. You gonna teach me the 'Not Burning' thing?"
 * Ariel: "It's all about focus, Issei. Riser's magic is just intense heat. If your mind is absolutely convinced the heat doesn't matter, your body responds. I'll show you some focus drills later." (Ariel cleverly attributes the magical feat to \text{MND}/focus, aligning with Phase 2).
Ariel's Observation: The Paradox of Power
During the long drive, Ariel's \text{MND} 1.7 and \text{SPR} 1.1 were constantly active, observing the Peerage's dynamics:
 * Rias: She kept glancing at Ariel in the rear-view mirror. Her aura was stressed. She was struggling to categorize him. She saw the fit human, yet the memory of the Hellfire dissolving was a constant, destabilizing factor in her logical, ranked world.
 * Akeno: She was observing Ariel with quiet amusement and intensity. Her \text{MND} was focused on his aura of calm—a level of serenity that few beings possessed, contrasting sharply with her own complex, volatile nature. She saw the potential for deeper understanding.
 * Asia: She was radiating a gentle, grateful \text{Holy Aura} (now mixed with a faint demonic taint from her reincarnation). She clung to Issei, clearly seeing Ariel as a protector and a friend.
Rias's Attempt to Categorize
Finally, Rias broke the silence, her eyes fixed on Ariel.
"Ariel-kun, your transformation was remarkably fast. What style of martial arts do you practice? I have never seen a human achieve such density without external tools."
Ariel answered truthfully, but vaguely—revealing his method without revealing the mechanism (the PTD).
"It's a mix, Kaichou. Mostly focused on CQC (Close Quarters Combat) and efficiency. I figured the best way to deal with a powerful opponent is to close the distance, neutralize the power source, and end the fight before it starts. The strength is just a side effect of the focus."
Kiba, who had been listening intently, leaned forward. "Neutralize the power source? You mean like disarming a mage?"
"More like nullifying the intent," Ariel clarified, giving a small, knowing glance at Kiba. "If you can convince your opponent that their strike is useless before they even execute it, you save a lot of energy." (He was subtly revealing the core principle of his \text{SPR} 1.1 technique through tactical language.)
Kiba looked intrigued, while Rias looked deeply confused. She knew that concept was beyond any known human martial art.
Arrival at the Lodge
They arrived at the secluded, high-altitude Gremory lodge. The air was crisp, and the surrounding area was shielded by powerful Demonic Wards.
"Ariel-kun, you'll bunk with Issei," Rias instructed. "Your role here is Observation and Advice. Do not engage in high-level sparring. We need you focused for the strategic assessment."
Ariel had successfully secured his perfect cover: the Tactical Advisor who was physically impressive but considered too weak to join the actual sparring.
This setup provided him with the ideal platform to launch Phase 2 (The Tactical Insight) tomorrow and demonstrate his \text{MND} 1.7 brilliance.

## The evening details will focus on Ariel using his enhanced \text{MND} to analyze the team's skillset (Option 1) and then executing a covert PTD training session to continue his preparation.
🏕️ Night 12: Analysis and Covert Training
Ariel's objective for the evening is two-fold:
 * Passive Analysis: Gather detailed data on the ORC members' fighting styles (Phase 2 preparation).
 * Covert Training: Execute PTD training without alerting the powerful Devils in the lodge.
6:00 PM – Dinner and Passive Analysis
The Gremory lodge was luxurious, but the atmosphere was tense. Rias spent the dinner reviewing strategy maps with Kiba and Akeno. Issei was focused on eating to recover energy, and Asia was adjusting to the presence of so much Demonic energy.
Ariel sat quietly, using his MND 1.7 to perform a detailed, passive analysis of the Peerage's natural fighting instincts and energy flow:
 * Kiba Yuuto (Knight): His aura flows with incredible speed, focused entirely on the blade. His movement is visually flawless, but his energy usage is slightly inefficient due to psychological pressure (Rias's engagement). Conclusion: His style is too reliant on frontal assault; Ariel needs to teach him economic movement and counter-flanking.
 * Koneko Toujou (Rook): Her power is raw and compressed. Her Demonic Aura flows perfectly through her limbs, but her focus is too narrow. She relies on brute strength and endurance, lacking the finesse to deal with a quicker, magical opponent. Conclusion: Ariel can teach her about utilizing minor redirection and efficiency to counter speed, not just power.
 * Akeno Himejima (Queen/Bishop): Her aura is the most complex—a blend of light and dark, Heavenly and Demonic energy. Her power is immense, but she has psychological brakes preventing her from using her true potential. Conclusion: Ariel cannot directly fix her mental block, but he can provide tactical insights to force her to use less efficient, but faster, magic chains.
11:00 PM – The Covert Training Session
After the Peerage retired, Ariel waited. The lodge was protected by Demonic Wards set by Rias and Akeno. These wards were designed to detect trespassing or the use of Demonic/Holy power.
Ariel's challenge: Access the PTD without triggering any Demonic Wards.
Ariel used his MGS Stealth Training (\text{PHY} 1.5) to move silently through the lodge, avoiding floor creaks and surveillance points. He located a secluded, non-magically warded closet near the attic.
He focused his \text{MND} on his PTD Access. Since the PTD is a Will/Consciousness construct, it does not emit any detectable energy signature (Demonic, Holy, or otherwise) when accessed—it operates purely within Ariel's consciousness.
 * Ariel entered the closet and sealed the door.
 * He focused his \text{SPR} 1.1 on achieving the highest level of Will Projection, completely suppressing the external perception of his body.
 * He successfully phased his consciousness into the PTD, leaving his physical body asleep but undetectable in the closet.
PTD Night 10: Final Prep for Phase 2
Ariel prioritized practical application over raw strength, ensuring his Tactical Insight (Phase 2) was flawless for tomorrow's training.
PTD Module 1: Tactical Application Rehearsal
Ariel ran a simulation of the ORC's current training field, populated with holographic copies of the peerage. He practiced moving amongst them, correcting their flaws through demonstrations.
 * He executed efficient movement drills mirroring Kiba’s style, showing how to achieve the same attack speed with 20\% less wasted effort.
 * He practiced counter-grappling maneuvers against Koneko's raw strength, demonstrating how a smaller frame can redirect mass.
PTD Module 2: Big Boss Rank Attempt
Ariel loaded the MGS VR one final time, attempting the Big Boss Rank—the mastery of stealth and efficiency. He needed to prove to himself that his tactical skills were truly absolute.
 * Result: After an hour of intense concentration, Ariel achieved the Big Boss Rank criteria in the MGS VR. He had mastered CQC, non-lethal stealth, and resource management.
> Observer: "Big Boss Rank achieved. \text{PHY} and \text{MND} integration validated. You are functionally the world's most effective non-magical infiltrator and combatant. Final MGS training complete. Future training will shift to specialized Anime/Manga combat scenarios."
> 
Ariel exited the PTD just before dawn, returning to his body in the closet. He was physically rested (thanks to the PTD's efficiency) and mentally prepared to begin Phase 2: The Tactical Insight.

## ☀️ Day 13 (Wednesday): Tactical Insight and Will Training
1. The Morning Training Scene: Optimizing the Peerage (Option 1)
The ORC began training in the forest clearing near the Gremory lodge. Rias was running basic drills, focusing on speed and coordination.
Intervention 1: Kiba vs. Koneko
Rias instructed Kiba and Koneko to spar to warm up. Kiba was a whirlwind of movement and blades, and Koneko was a fortress of silent strength.
Ariel watched from the sidelines, leaning against a tree. His \text{MND} 1.7 was cataloging every movement. He noticed that Kiba was wasting energy, and Koneko was relying too much on her brute defense.
"Stop!" Rias called, frustrated. "Kiba, you’re missing your openings. Koneko, you need to move!"
Ariel stepped forward, radiating nothing but the calm intensity of a coach.
"Kiba-kun, you're using 15\% too much energy per strike," Ariel stated, walking over. "Your goal as a Knight is economic speed. You're using a large, sweeping motion to change direction, which slows your attack-to-defense transition."
Ariel demonstrated a pivot: he moved his \text{PHY} 1.5 body with impossible economy—a seamless, instant shift in weight.
"Instead of shifting your center, pivot your hips," Ariel instructed Kiba. "It maintains momentum and saves the energy for the strike. Economy of Motion."
He turned to Koneko. "Toujou-san, you're relying on your density. That's fine, but against Riser's speed, you'll be outflanked. When Kiba swings, don't meet his force directly; use your strength to redirect his momentum just enough, turning his energy against his own balance. Use what's given."
Koneko's eyes widened slightly. She immediately understood the leverage point he was describing.
Rias and Akeno stared at Ariel. He hadn't used magic or demonic power. He had simply analyzed and corrected flaws that even they, high-class devils, had not seen due to their focus on magic.
Result: Phase 2 Complete. Ariel is now cemented as the Tactical Genius/Coach for the camp.
2. One-on-One: Teaching Issei Will and Focus (Option 2)
Later that afternoon, Ariel pulled Issei aside. Issei was disheartened by his weak 10-second limit on the Boosted Gear.
"Ariel, I'm useless! Riser will crush me and take Rias before I can even finish boosting!" Issei vented.
Ariel nodded, sympathetic. "You're right. Raw power isn't enough, especially with that time limit. But the Boosted Gear isn't magic, Issei. It's a Sacred Gear. It operates on Will and Emotion."
Ariel had observed Issei's use of the gear—it spiked violently when he got angry or determined.
"I can't teach you magic, but I can teach you how to focus your Will," Ariel offered.
The Focus Drill
Ariel sat Issei down and had him focus on a single, insignificant stone.
"Now, Issei, I want you to project the truth of your desire onto that stone. Not with magic, but with your deepest feeling. Tell that stone why you want to be the Harem King and why you want to protect Rias."
Issei looked confused, but complied. He closed his eyes and poured his raw, perverted determination into the image of Rias and Asia.
Ariel then activated a faint, controlled layer of his \text{SPR} 1.1—not to attack, but to simulate the external pressure of Riser's aura.
"Now, Issei, Riser is laughing at you. He's telling you you're trash," Ariel whispered calmly. "Don't fight his power; fight his doubt. Use your focus to command your Will not to break."
Issei's knuckles turned white. He projected his fierce resolve against Ariel's simulated pressure.
Suddenly, his hand flashed. The Boosted Gear manifested—not with a roar, but with a steady, stable glow.
Ariel immediately checked the time: 15 seconds.
"You held it, Issei," Ariel said, suppressing his excitement. "You held the focus 5 seconds longer. The Gear responds to absolute, unshakeable Will, not just anger. If you train your Willpower, you train the Gear."
Issei looked at his gauntlet, awestruck. "Ariel... that actually worked. I felt... solid."
Result: Secret \text{SPR}/Will Training established. Ariel has now cemented his status as Issei's personal mental coach, ensuring Issei's growth remains stable and efficient for the battle ahead.

## ⚔️ Day 14 (Thursday): Economy of Motion and The Unseen Shield
1. Morning Training: Refining the Knight (Option 1)
Ariel focused his attention on Kiba Yuuto, the fastest member of the peerage, but one who was fundamentally inefficient due to his reliance on speed to overcome flaws.
They were sparring in the clearing—Kiba's swords flashing in a dizzying torrent against a training dummy.
"Again, Kiba-kun! Faster!" Rias urged.
Ariel stepped in, having observed the energy drain on Kiba's aura.
"Stop for a moment, Yuuto-kun," Ariel requested calmly. "You're fast, but speed is wasted if you spend 30\% of it correcting your balance."
Ariel had Kiba slow down and execute his signature Sword Birth slash. Ariel's \text{MND} 1.7 immediately pinpointed the flaw: Kiba's shoulder slightly over-rotated, wasting kinetic energy that should have gone into the cut.
"When you attack, your energy flow is beautiful, but your physical frame is holding it back," Ariel explained. "Watch."
Ariel borrowed one of Kiba's wooden swords. Ariel's \text{PHY} 1.5 allowed him to mirror Kiba's technique, but with a slight, unearthly difference. Ariel executed the exact same slash, but his body moved with pure, effortless economy. His sword arrived at the target marginally slower than Kiba's, but his breathing was even, and his stance remained perfectly centered—ready for the next move.
"That's the Economy of Motion," Ariel stated. "Every muscle fiber works only to execute the move, not to resist physics. Your strength is your speed; your endurance should be your defense. If you can move like this, you conserve the energy you need for powerful Sacred Gear usage in the later stages of the Rating Game."
Kiba stared at Ariel's performance. He hadn't used any aura, yet his execution was flawless—a level of physical mastery that should have been impossible for a non-magical human. Kiba's respect for Ariel solidified immediately.
Result: Kiba's training is optimized. Ariel provided a non-magical, physical path to efficiency, which Kiba, as a specialist, could immediately utilize and appreciate.
2. Evening Intervention: The Critical Nullification (Option 2)
That evening, a minor threat materialized. The sheer concentration of high-level Demonic energy from Rias and her peerage had naturally attracted a low-level Stray Beast/Monster from the surrounding woods—a grotesque, large wolf-like creature covered in low-grade \text{Demonic Scales}.
The monster breached the outer perimeter, crashing toward the lodge, roaring and spitting a low-level, high-impact Sonic Scream attack—a wide, invisible wave of force designed to disorient and stun.
The Peerage—tired from the day's training—was slow to react. Akeno instinctively started charging lightning magic, but the Sonic Scream was too fast. It rushed toward the cluster of tired Devils, aiming to neutralize them before they could activate their high-level defenses.
Ariel, who was walking back from the main training clearing, saw the attack. He knew this was the moment to stabilize the situation without fighting.
Ariel acted without moving.
He focused his full SPR 1.1 not on the monster, but on the invisible Sonic Scream wave itself.
Ariel issued the silent, absolute command: "Be still."
The Sonic Scream wave, which moments before was tearing up the earth, hit an invisible, localized field centered on Ariel—and vanished. It wasn't blocked; the energy flow was instantly neutralized and dissipated into non-existence.
The monster continued its charge, confused.
Rias, Akeno, and Kiba, who were bracing for impact, were hit by... nothing. They felt an impossible void where the force should have been.
Akeno, having completed her charge, instinctively fired a bolt of lightning, instantly vaporizing the confused Stray Beast.
Rias looked around, frantic. "What happened? I felt the attack! It was right there!"
Kiba looked toward Ariel, who had just stepped out of the shadow of a tree, looking slightly tired but otherwise fine.
"That was… strange," Kiba muttered. "The attack just disappeared right where Ariel-kun was standing."
Ariel played the moment off with his most innocent expression. "The scream? Yeah, that thing was loud. Maybe the wards kicked in right at the last second? Those Gremory Wards are intense, Kaichou."
Rias stared at Ariel. She knew the wards hadn't triggered. She knew the attack had simply stopped near the only human present. His aura was still zero.
Rias’s Internal Conclusion: This human is an enigma. He possesses an instantaneous defensive reflex that can nullify energy, yet he registers zero power. He is the Mortal Variable—a friendly, unpredictable factor that could save them, or destroy them. She now had to rely on him.
Result: Phase 3 (Unquantifiable Will) advanced. Ariel's defensive "trick" is now an established, yet unexplainable, event for the Peerage.

## ⚡ Night 14: Stress Testing and Presence Stabilization
Ariel returned to the PTD, his mind buzzing with the tactical breakthroughs from the day and the unsettling tension of the Stray Beast intervention. He dedicated the night to pushing his SPR and PHY limits.
1. High-Stress Anime/Manga Simulation (Option 1)
Ariel needed a simulation that would stress his \text{PHY} and \text{MND} to the maximum without relying on overwhelming, universe-breaking power (like Dragon Ball).
> PTD Module: Specialized Stress Test. Threat: Jellal Fernandes (from Fairy Tail). Goal: Sustain a simultaneous defense against high-speed physical assault (\text{PHY}) and continuous magic attack (SPR) for 30 seconds. Focus: Interleaving \text{CQC} and \text{Nullification Intent}.
> 
Ariel materialized in the simulation facing Jellal, who immediately launched a barrage of rapid-fire spells, culminating in a powerful Meteor physical attack.
Ariel's strategy wasn't to fight, but to survive flawlessly:
 * Nullification Defense: Ariel used his \text{SPR} 1.1 to create micro-nullification fields around the incoming magical projectiles (simulating Heavenly Body Magic), causing them to dissipate microseconds before impact. This required intense focus from his \text{MND} 1.7.
 * CQC Counter: When Jellal closed the distance with Meteor, Ariel used his \text{PHY} 1.5 CQC mastery not to strike, but to redirect the extreme force, minimizing the impact before transitioning back to energy defense.
Ariel successfully sustained the dual defense for 30 agonizing seconds before the PTD ended the simulation due to accumulated stress (though he was physically untouched). The exercise confirmed his ability to handle advanced, sustained magical and physical assaults simultaneously.
 * Result: The high, continuous stress forced his mind and spiritual reserves to adapt rapidly. Gain: \text{MND} + 0.1 (Multitasking Under Pressure). \text{SPR} optimization.
2. Personal Development: Presence Stabilization (Option 2)
With the simulation complete, Ariel moved to stabilize his most crucial, yet subtle, weapon: his Will Projection or Presence. This was the key to making Riser hesitate (Phase 3).
> PTD Module: Presence Refinement. Target: Stabilize the low-level Fear Aura to act as a passive emotional disruptor. The projection must be subtle enough that only Riser's instincts register it, not his conscious mind.
> 
Ariel entered the Zen Garden. Instead of commanding energy to stop, he commanded his Existence to project an aura of absolute, unmovable certainty. This was the emotional opposite of Riser's arrogance.
He focused his \text{SPR} 1.1 to project a cold, crushing weight—the feeling of a predator who has already decided the outcome. He sustained it for five full minutes, focusing on control and subtlety rather than brute force.
 * Result: The stabilization was successful. Ariel now possesses a stable, passive \text{SPR} that can disrupt the confidence and emotional balance of high-class individuals who rely on their own overwhelming aura. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.1 (Will Stability).
📈 Current Status and Next Step
Ariel has successfully trained for both offensive intervention and passive stabilization, bringing his capabilities to a significantly higher, more stable level.
Current Status Check:
 * PHY: 1.5 (CQC Master / Optimized)
 * MND: 1.8 (Absolute Tactical Genius)
 * SPR: 1.2 (High Stability Will / Nullifier)

## 🥋 Day 15 (Friday): Redirection and Trust
1. Morning Training: Redirection with Koneko (Option 1)
Ariel focused his morning session on Koneko Toujou. As the Rook, her primary role in the Rating Game would be defense and holding ground. Her strength was immense, but against Riser's speed and ranged peerage, she needed efficiency to avoid being overwhelmed.
Ariel had Koneko strike a massive training dummy multiple times.
"Toujou-san, your power is incredible," Ariel noted. "But you're using 100\% of your strength to meet the force head-on. That will drain your energy quickly against Riser's Rook, who can fight you to a standstill."
Ariel demonstrated the Redirection Principle. He had Kiba (who was still practicing his new footwork) charge him. As Kiba lunged with speed, Ariel didn't meet the force. Instead, he used a small, precise movement of his \text{PHY} 1.5 body—a slight pivot and a quick hand placement—to redirect Kiba's momentum past him.
"Don't stop the force, borrow it," Ariel instructed. "Use your opponent's momentum to slightly shift their center of gravity. That tiny shift forces them to expend energy correcting their stance, while you've spent none. You're the immovable object; learn to be the perfect pivot point."
Koneko, whose style was naturally rigid, struggled at first. Ariel patiently worked with her, using his \text{MND} 1.8 to pinpoint the exact millisecond her posture broke. By the end of the session, Koneko was able to effortlessly redirect Kiba's speed, using only 5\% of her raw power. She gave Ariel a rare, small, grateful nod.
Result: Koneko's defense is optimized. Ariel provided a means for her to conserve energy and increase her defensive range, making her a much more valuable asset in the Rating Game.
2. Afternoon Interaction: Gaining Rias's Trust (Option 2)
Later that afternoon, Rias was alone, sitting on the porch railing, looking out at the mountains. The pressure of the Rating Game was clearly weighing on her.
Ariel approached her calmly, carrying two cups of tea he'd made.
"Kaichou," Ariel said softly, offering her a cup. "You look like you could use a break."
Rias accepted the tea, surprised by his simple, human kindness. "Thank you, Ariel-kun."
"I know I'm just a human, but I wanted to tell you what I observed about Riser yesterday," Ariel began, his voice lowered.
He switched into his Tactical Genius mode, using his \text{MND} 1.8 analysis from the previous night.
"Riser's power is overwhelming, but his aura is predictable. He radiates complete arrogance and certainty. That certainty is his tactical blind spot. He won't anticipate subtle deviations from the rules of combat. He expects brute power, not finesse."
Ariel outlined his conclusion concisely:
 * Rook/Knight Counter: "Your team can't beat his Rook and Knight in raw strength. But if Koneko uses Redirection and Kiba uses Economy of Motion, they can wear down Riser's forces through exhaustion and efficiency."
 * The Queen's Role: "You must stay in reserve, Kaichou. Riser is expecting you to use your power to save Issei. You must break that expectation. Your value isn't just your power; it's your political influence and your team's morale."
Rias looked at him, completely captivated. He was speaking purely in terms of strategy, psychology, and physical laws, yet his advice felt more insightful than anything her devil advisors had ever given her.
"Ariel-kun... why are you doing this?" Rias asked, the core question finally posed. "You're risking your life for a conflict that does not involve your kind. And that... incident with the fire and the monster's scream... I can't detect any power from you, yet you stopped them both. What is your goal?"
Ariel maintained his sincere, warm gaze. This was the moment for the Veritas (Truth), but filtered through the Silhouette strategy.
"My goal is simple, Kaichou: I hate bullies. And Riser is the ultimate bully, trying to steal your future," Ariel said, his voice quiet but intense. "As for the powers... think of it this way: I may not have the magic or demonic energy of your world, but I have absolute Will and Focus. What you see is just the result of extreme training that allows me to command what I will and what I will not allow to happen to me or my friends. I refuse to break, and I refuse to burn."
Rias finally understood the paradox. He was not a devil or a god; he was a human who had somehow achieved absolute dominion over his own existence. She couldn't classify him, but she could trust him.
"You're an extraordinary human, Ariel Caelum Veritas," Rias conceded, giving him a rare, genuine smile. "I'll take your advice. I need your eyes on our strategy."
Result: Ariel gains Rias's trust. He is now officially the Tactical Advisor for the Rating Game, securing his political influence and ensuring his plans will be followed.

## 💥 Night 15 (Friday): Apex Agility and Crushing Presence
Ariel knew the clock was ticking. The Rating Game was mere days away. He loaded the PTD, pushing his physical and spiritual limits to their absolute breaking points.
1. High-Stress Anime/Manga Simulation (Option 1)
Ariel needed a challenge that would force his \text{PHY} and \text{MND} to a level of near-superhuman agility and strategic processing.
> PTD Module: Apex Agility & Strategic Combat. Threat: Minato Namikaze (from Naruto), renowned for his Flying Raijin Jutsu (teleportation) and extreme combat speed. Goal: Survive against Minato for 1 minute, avoiding all direct hits, forcing him to engage in complex tactical maneuvers. Focus: \text{MND} for prediction, \text{PHY} for instantaneous reaction.
> 
Ariel materialized in a simulated forest, facing the legendary "Yellow Flash." Minato's speed was terrifying—he vanished and reappeared, attacking from multiple angles simultaneously.
Ariel's strategy was not to fight, but to predict and evade flawlessly.
 * MND-Driven Prediction: Ariel's \text{MND} 1.8 worked overtime, processing Minato's subtle intent before the teleportation. He didn't just react; he predicted the next destination before Minato reappeared, allowing him to initiate evasive action early.
 * PHY-Driven Evasion: His \text{PHY} 1.5 body moved with impossible fluidity, making micro-adjustments, shifting his weight by mere centimeters to evade Minato's kunai and close-quarters strikes. He used the environment, ducking behind trees, using his stealth mastery to momentarily break Minato's line of sight.
Ariel survived the full minute, having avoided every direct hit, though the mental strain was immense. He had pushed his agility and predictive capabilities to an insane level.
 * Result: Breakthrough in predictive evasion and reaction speed. Ariel can now consistently predict and evade attacks from high-speed, teleporting opponents. Gain: \text{MND} + 0.2 (Extreme Predictive Capability). PHY Optimization.
2. Presence Projection: The Fear Aura (Option 2)
Ariel immediately followed the intense mental strain with a focused session on his \text{SPR} 1.2, aiming to achieve a passive, disruptive Fear Aura that would subtly erode Riser's confidence.
> PTD Module: Crushing Presence. Target: Achieve a sustainable, low-level Fear Aura that subtly disorients opponents without direct energy expenditure. This will impact psychological pressure and command structure.
> 
Ariel re-entered the void. This time, he didn't project stillness or neutrality. He projected the cold, absolute certainty of inevitability. He visualized a vast, silent predator calmly observing its prey, knowing the outcome.
He focused his \text{SPR} 1.2 to expand his Presence beyond his immediate vicinity, creating a subtle, oppressive aura that clung to the air itself. It wasn't raw power; it was the psychological weight of a force that refused to be defied. He sustained it for ten continuous minutes.
 * Result: The passive Fear Aura is now stable. Ariel's presence will subtly induce unease, doubt, and hesitation in those who rely on arrogance and intimidation, like Riser. This is a powerful, non-magical psychological weapon. Gain: \text{SPR} + 0.2 (Presence Mastery).
📈 Final Status Check and Readiness for Rating Game
Ariel has achieved a terrifying level of personal power, making him a true Mortal Variable capable of intervening in the Riser Rating Game.
Current Status Check:
 * PHY: 1.5 (Apex Agility, CQC Master)
 * MND: 2.0 (Predictive Genius, Master Strategist)
 * SPR: 1.4 (Crushing Presence, Nullification Master)
Readiness for Rating Game: Ariel is fully prepared. He can move faster than most devils can process, predict their actions, nullify their magic, and subtly erode their confidence through his sheer, unquantifiable Will. He is ready to infiltrate, advise, and intervene.

## 🎲 Day 18: The Riser Rating Game
1. Final Preparations and Ariel's Advice (Morning)
The atmosphere in the Gremory lodge was suffocatingly tense. The peerage was dressed in their battle attire, their auras flickering with determination and anxiety.
Ariel stood calmly in the center of the room. His presence, now stabilized at SPR 1.4, acted like an emotional insulator, subtly dampening the waves of fear and stress coming from Issei and Asia.
"Listen up, everyone," Ariel began, his voice clear and concise. He wasn't giving a motivational speech; he was giving an operational briefing, activating his MND 2.0 (Predictive Genius).
"Riser's strategy is simple: overwhelming offense and psychological warfare. He expects us to fight back with brute force and lose morale."
He addressed each team member with their final, optimized tactical brief:
 * Rias (Queen/King): "Kaichou, you must conserve your power. Riser's game will be about exhausting your reserves. Position yourself in a defensible location. Your role is Reserve Power and Command, not vanguard. Your sacrifice is the last option."
 * Akeno (Queen/Bishop): "Akeno-san, you're the engine of the defense. Use your magic in short, rapid, chained bursts—not full-power charges. Break the two-second delay. Be the constant irritant that defends the flank."
 * Kiba (Knight): "Yuuto-kun, Economy of Motion is your life insurance. Every move must be precise, conserving energy. Target Riser's Knight and Bishop, forcing them into defensive pivots. Your speed is their exhaustion."
 * Koneko (Rook): "Toujou-san, you are the rock. Use the Redirection technique. Don't fight their force; redirect it and force them to re-stabilize. You will hold the line longer than they expect."
 * Issei (Pawn): Ariel placed a hand on Issei's shoulder. "Issei, your power comes from your Will and your desire to protect. Focus on the 15-second stability we trained for. Don't let Riser’s taunts break your concentration. Your strength is your heart; never forget that."
The Final Morale Boost
Ariel looked at the entire team. He subtly ramped up his Presence Projection. The quiet, confident crush of his \text{SPR} 1.4 filled the room. It didn't feel like magic; it felt like the absolute certainty of victory radiating from the most grounded person they knew.
"You are stronger than you realize," Ariel finished. "They see ranks and power levels. I see strategy and heart. We have the strategy. Now, let's go shock the Underworld."
Rias nodded, her tension visibly easing. She had absolute faith in the tactical genius of the human she couldn't categorize.
2. The Start of the Rating Game (Deployment)
Rias opened the teleportation circle. As a non-devil, Ariel could not be deployed as a piece. Rias had devised a plan based on Ariel's Mortal Variable status.
"Ariel-kun, since you register as neutral, Grayfia has agreed to treat you as an Observation Asset outside the formal board," Rias explained. "Akeno will use a modified long-distance communication ward to keep you connected. You will be observing the entire field from a strategically vital point and relaying commands."
Ariel nodded, knowing this was the optimal infiltration plan—placing him where his MND 2.0 and SPR 1.4 could have maximum influence.
Deployment and Infiltration
The teleportation circle flared, and Ariel found himself standing on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast, medieval-style fortress—Riser's home territory.
Akeno, who was positioned far away at the perimeter, stabilized the communication ward: a faint, pulsating light near Ariel's ear, linked to her command center.
"Ariel-kun, can you hear me?" Akeno's voice was a low hum in his ear.
"Loud and clear, Akeno-san," Ariel confirmed.
He immediately activated his MND 2.0 and SPR 1.4 at full capacity:
 * MND 2.0 (Strategic Map): Ariel scanned the entire fortress and its surroundings. His mind instantly processed the optimal routes for Kiba and Koneko, the likely ambush points, and the precise location of Riser's King. The entire battleground was instantly mapped into his mind.
 * SPR 1.4 (Passive Presence): Ariel subtly expanded his Presence to encompass the area around the fortress—not as an attack, but as an environmental pressure. Riser and his peerage, who were already deployed, would feel a constant, subtle, unidentifiable pressure, eroding their confidence and making their command structure feel uneasy.
The Rating Game officially began. Riser's voice boomed over the field, arrogant and full of fire.
"Rias Gremory! This is my stage! Surrender, and save your servants the pain!"
Ariel's voice, calm and detached, cut through the tension to Akeno.
"Akeno-san, relay this immediately: Riser's Rook and Knight are positioned in the south garrison. Kiba, flank through the western forest path—exploit the tree line for cover. Koneko, hold the central courtyard. Initiate the offensive now."
The game was afoot, and the Mortal Variable was now directing the strategy from the unseen heights.

## ⚔️ The Riser Rating Game: Ariel's Intervention
Phase 1: Tactical Command and Decisive Strike (Option 2)
Ariel, perched on the rocky outcrop as the Observation Asset, had the perfect vantage point. His MND 2.0 (Predictive Genius) immediately locked onto the flow of the battle, analyzing Riser's deployment.
Riser's Knight, a muscular devil focused on brute-force speed, lunged toward Kiba and Koneko in the central courtyard. Ariel's \text{SPR} Crushing Presence was already subtly working, causing the Knight to slightly hesitate and overcommit his opening move—a flicker of doubt Riser's side couldn't explain.
Akeno's voice, relayed through the communication ward, crackled in Ariel's ear: "Ariel-kun, command?"
Ariel's response was instant and precise, a chess master moving three turns ahead.
"Kiba, full retreat, draw the Knight toward the south wall's blind spot! Koneko, hold position, but activate Redirection on the wall behind you—prepare for a rebound."
Kiba executed the command perfectly, using his newfound Economy of Motion to retreat at max speed, tempting Riser’s Knight to follow with a massive sword slash. The Knight charged, focusing only on Kiba.
As Kiba darted aside, the Knight’s sword slammed into the wall. Koneko had positioned herself so the massive impact force rebounded off her redirected Rook strength and the fortress wall, stunning and disorienting Riser's Knight as he was hit by his own kinetic energy.
"Now, Kiba! Finish the target!" Ariel commanded.
Kiba, perfectly centered and fresh due to his conserved energy, capitalized on the momentary stagger, using a powerful Sword Birth strike to defeat the disoriented Knight.
> [Riser Peerage Message]: Riser's Knight, Defeated.
> 
The ORC cheered softly. Ariel’s flawless tactical setup had eliminated a key piece in the opening minutes, stunning Rias and Akeno with his strategic speed.
Phase 2: The Nullification Shield (Option 1)
Riser's team immediately retaliated. Seeing the Knight's defeat, Riser's Rook, a massive, armored figure, bellowed in rage and unleashed a colossal, high-density Demonic Energy Blast aimed squarely at Koneko, who was still recovering her redirected energy.
The blast was too fast for Akeno to intercept with her Queen magic, and Koneko was momentarily pinned down.
Ariel saw the incoming attack. This was the moment for the Mortal Variable to intervene—without firing a shot. He focused his full SPR 1.4 (Nullification Master) on the spatial energy of the blast.
He mentally issued the command: "Be Void."
The multi-ton, crimson-red Demonic Blast surged across the courtyard and, three feet before it would have incinerated Koneko, it hit an invisible, localized Will Field. The blast didn't explode; it didn't deflect; it simply ceased to exist, dissipating instantly into nothingness.
The sheer volume of nullified energy caused a brief, localized static discharge—like a magical circuit failing—in the Rating Game field itself.
> [Rating Game Administrator Message]: ERROR. Energy Fluctuation Detected. Local Ward Failure.
> 
Riser's Rook stared in confusion. Koneko blinked, feeling only a rush of hot air and the faint smell of ozone.
Ariel’s cover was secure. He had no Demonic or Holy signature, so the Administrator assumed a system error or a ward failure. Rias and Akeno, however, knew immediately what they had witnessed: the human had just nullified a high-class attack as a passive reflex.
Ariel's calm voice returned to Akeno's ear: "Koneko is safe. Riser's Rook has exposed his rear flank in his fury. Kiba, flank left—assist Koneko. Do not give the Rook time to stabilize."
The battle continued, but Riser's peerage now fought with a rising sense of dread, convinced the very rules of the game were turning against them, thanks to the Crushing Presence of the invisible tactical advisor.

## ⚔️ The Riser Rating Game: Phase 3 – Calculated Attrition
A Shift in Command
Riser's side was reeling. The elimination of the Knight and the inexplicable failure of the Rook's counter-attack had shattered the arrogance of their initial deployment.
Ariel's voice, calm and precise, was the only certainty in the ORC's ranks.
"Akeno-san, focus your lightning strikes on the ground around Riser's Rook," Ariel commanded. "Do not aim to defeat it; aim to herd it. Force it away from the fortress wall and into the open central courtyard."
Akeno immediately understood the strategy. Using her low-level, rapid-fire lightning bursts (thanks to Ariel’s advice), she peppered the ground around the Rook, restricting its movement.
The Rook's Trap
Riser's Rook, blinded by fury and confused by the continuous pressure, charged into the open ground as Ariel intended.
"Now!" Ariel barked. "Koneko, full commitment! Use the environment!"
Koneko, knowing exactly where to strike, used a single, powerful surge of her \text{Rook} strength to smash a section of the cobblestone courtyard. She didn't hit the Rook; she created a massive, uneven crater.
The Rook, running at high speed, stumbled violently, its balance completely ruined by the sudden terrain shift.
"Kiba, finish the combination!"
Kiba materialized in the Rook's blind spot, using the fractional time the Rook spent recovering its balance to unleash a high-speed, concentrated Sword Birth strike.
> [Riser Peerage Message]: Riser's Rook, Defeated.
> 
Escalation and Frustration
Two major pieces were eliminated in rapid succession, all thanks to the flawlessly executed strategy dictated by the unseen command.
In the fortress, Riser Phenex roared in frustration. His aura flared, turning the sky above the fortress a deep orange.
"Who dares interfere! This is impossible! They are moving like a well-oiled machine!" Riser bellowed, his voice filled with venom.
Ariel, observing Riser's emotional instability through his MND 2.0, knew the critical moment was approaching. The goal was never to eliminate all pieces; it was to break Riser's spirit so Issei could fight him one-on-one.
"Akeno-san, I see Riser sending his Bishops to flank the west," Ariel reported, his voice softening with confidence. "Rias, the pieces are now even. It's time for the final push. Issei, prepare your focus drills."
Rias's voice, now strong and fully resolute, addressed the field: "Issei! Go!"
The Pawn's Advance
Issei, who had been largely kept in reserve, raced toward the main fortress gate, his Boosted Gear roaring with steady power—a testament to Ariel's Will Training.
Riser's remaining forces immediately converged on the lone Pawn. The battle devolved into a fierce, disorganized melee.
Ariel’s final strategic role was to ensure Issei reached Riser intact, minimizing the psychological damage from Riser's peerage.

## 💥 Phase 4: The Final Confrontation (Issei vs. Riser)
1. Issei's Duel and Ariel's Remote Guidance (Option 1)
Issei, utilizing the efficient routes and distractions engineered by Ariel, smashed through Riser's remaining forces and finally faced Riser Phenex in the central throne room of the simulated castle.
Riser was furious, his immortality barely holding back his rage over the loss of his pieces.
"How dare you, Pawn! This is not skill; this is cheap trickery! I will burn you alive!" Riser screamed, unleashing a massive torrent of Hellfire.
Issei braced himself, his Boosted Gear flickering. Riser's terrifying aura was almost overwhelming.
Ariel’s voice, calm and clear, cut through the noise in Issei's ear (relayed via Akeno).
"Issei! Remember your focus! Riser is attacking your Will!"
Issei closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, recalling Ariel's Will Training. He poured every ounce of his determination—his desire to protect Rias and be the Harem King—into his Gear. The flickering stopped. The Boosted Gear stabilized, shining fiercely.
"BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!"
Issei charged, meeting the fire head-on.
The Intervention: Psychological Disruption
Riser launched a physical attack, expecting Issei to wilt under his overwhelming pressure and power. But as Riser closed the distance, he was hit by Ariel's Crushing Presence (\text{SPR} \text{ } 1.4)—a sudden, subtle weight of certainty and inevitability that made Riser hesitate, if only for a half-second.
Riser's Internal Thought: What is this pressure? It feels like the very outcome is guaranteed against me! I sense no magic!
That micro-second of hesitation was all Issei needed.
Ariel's final tactical command: "Issei! Target the core—the heart! Use the speed he gave you!"
Issei utilized the gap, delivering a massive, focused blow to Riser's abdomen, followed by the canonical power surge. The blow was so concentrated that Riser's immortality struggled to cope.
The subsequent chaos and Issei's final, desperate surge of power led to the canonical, painful victory.
> [Rating Game Administrator Message]: Riser Phenex, Defeated.
> 
The match ended in a blinding flash of red light.
🏆 Phase 5: Post-Game Analysis and Future Setup
2. The Post-Game Analysis (Option 2)
Ariel and the ORC were instantly teleported back to the lodge, exhausted but triumphant. Issei was quickly rushed away for healing with the Gremory family's Phoenix Tears.
Rias immediately sought out Ariel. She was emotionally exhausted but radiant with relief.
"Ariel-kun... you saved us," she whispered, her eyes wet. "Your tactical commands, the way you orchestrated Kiba and Koneko... it was flawless. And those glitches... the fire and the blast disappearing..."
Akeno stood beside her, her smile gone, replaced by deep curiosity. "You are not just a human, Ariel-kun. You possess something that defies all supernatural laws we know."
Ariel accepted the praise with humility but remained firm in his Silhouette explanation.
"Kaichou, I'm just consistent," Ariel stated. "I saw a path to victory, and everyone executed the plan. As for the glitches, the Rating Game is a system; systems have bugs. My job was just to keep the field stable and keep Issei focused. He won it himself."
Rias did not press him further. She realized that forcing the issue would alienate him. She accepted the paradox.
> "Ariel Caelum Veritas," Rias said, extending her hand. "You are more than an ally; you are a Variable that cannot be ignored. Thank you."
> 
Personal Growth Reflection
Ariel used the next two days while the peerage recovered to analyze his performance and prepare for the next phase.
 * Rating Game Analysis: His MND 2.0 and SPR 1.4 performed perfectly, proving their effectiveness in high-stress, real-world scenarios. He was satisfied with the outcome but recognized his physical limitations.
 * The New Goal: While his mind could predict attacks (\text{MND} \text{ } 2.0) and his Will could nullify magic (\text{SPR} \text{ } 1.4), his body (\text{PHY} \text{ } 1.5) was still a target. If Riser had managed a physical strike, Ariel would have been severely injured.
Ariel decided his next power leap must focus on achieving supernatural physical durability and integrating his sensory abilities into his physical reflexes. This aligns perfectly with the future training plan.
📈 Next Phase Setup: The Body of the Silhouette
Ariel has successfully defeated the Riser Phenex threat and gained the full, if confused, trust of the Gremory Peerage. The next major arc is the Kyoto Excursion/Khaos Brigade setup, requiring increased physical toughness and refined sensory abilities.
The Training Shift: Ariel will now focus on the Luffy/Rayleigh-style training—integrating his mind into his body to achieve impossible physical resilience and absolute predictive sensing.

## This is the perfect way to set up the next major character evolution: a solo power-up followed by a heartfelt, strategic reveal that deepens the connection with the entire peerage.
We will execute the final solo PTD training session to hit the \text{PHY} \text{ } 2.0 benchmark, followed by the detailed, multi-conversation reveal scene.
⚡ Post-Riser Recovery: Pushing the Body (Option 2)
During the days immediately following the Rating Game, while Issei was recovering with the Phoenix Tears and the Gremory peerage was celebrating their political victory, Ariel focused on eliminating his single remaining weakness: his average human durability.
His goal: to achieve \text{PHY} \text{ } 2.0 through a high-stress simulation focusing on raw physical endurance and impact resistance, setting the stage for the One Piece-style hardening techniques later.
PTD Night: The Enduring Mercenary
Ariel loaded a simulation that demanded sustained physical toughness against specialized human combatants.
> PTD Module: God of Black Field (Endurance Test). Threat: Kaghn/Kang Chan (The protagonist of God of Black Field), renowned for his battlefield instinct and brutal, efficient \text{CQC} focus on pressure points and breaking bones. Goal: Sustain 5 minutes of continuous physical sparring without receiving a critical hit. Focus: Raw impact absorption and \text{CQC} defense.
> 
Ariel faced a relentless, highly trained mercenary who fought without magic, using pure skill and brutal power. Ariel used his \text{MND} \text{ } 2.0 to predict every attack and his \text{PHY} \text{ } 1.5 to evade and counter. However, in this simulation, Ariel focused on allowing controlled, non-critical hits to push his body's actual resistance to blunt force trauma.
 * He deliberately took controlled hits to his muscle mass, forcing the simulated damage to trigger the PTD's advanced healing and adaptation protocols.
 * The pain was intense, focusing entirely on structural integrity and trauma resistance.
The five minutes concluded with Ariel battered but unbroken. He had absorbed and resisted the full, crushing force of a peak military combatant.
 * Result: Breakthrough in blunt force trauma resistance and physical durability. The PTD recorded a major adaptation, pushing his physical frame far beyond the human maximum. Gain: \text{PHY} + 0.5.
🌟 Status Check: \text{PHY} \text{ } 2.0 Reached!
Ariel stepped out of the PTD. His body was now incredibly dense, far surpassing the limits of a normal athlete. He had the durability needed to start training the One Piece-style hardening.
Current Status Check:
 * PHY: 2.0 (Superhuman Durability)
 * MND: 2.0 (Predictive Genius)
 * SPR: 1.4 (Crushing Presence, Nullifier)
🫂 Phase 4: The Full Veritas Revelation (Option 1)
Ariel waited until the entire Occult Research Club was together and recovered. He gathered them in the clubroom after school, a day after Riser's defeat.
The atmosphere was relaxed, celebratory, and filled with gratitude toward their "Tactical Genius" and "Anomaly."
Conversation 1: Setting the Stage (The Name and The Motivation)
Ariel stood before the Peerage—Rias, Akeno, Kiba, Koneko, Issei, and Asia.
"I called you all here because I owe you the truth," Ariel started, his voice serious but warm. "You trusted my strategy completely, even when it sounded crazy. Now I need to explain the anomaly you’ve been seeing."
Rias leaned forward, her emerald eyes intense. "Ariel-kun, what is the truth? That incident with the Hellfire... it still defies all logic."
Ariel nodded. "Let's start with my full name: I am Ariel Caelum Veritas. And Veritas, in Latin, means Truth. That is the foundation of who I am."
He paused, ensuring he held their complete attention.
"You're right, I'm not a devil, or an angel, or a spirit. I am fully human. But the reason I can do what I do—the speed, the strategy, the nullifying—is because I was given a system that allows me to achieve absolute physical and mental perfection through continuous, intense training."
Issei tilted his head. "Wait, a system? Like a video game?"
"Something like that," Ariel confirmed. "It’s a training environment that removes all the limitations of the human mind and body, allowing me to push past thresholds of speed, perception, and willpower that shouldn't be possible. I achieved a high level of MND (Mental Perception), SPR (Spiritual Will), and PHY (Physicality)."
Akeno looked fascinated. "So your abilities aren't inherent magic, but the perfect utilization of human potential?"
"Exactly," Ariel confirmed. "I can nullify magic because my Will is trained to refuse to allow that energy to interact with my personal space. I was able to predict Riser's movements because my Mind is trained to process information at an accelerated rate."
"And your goal?" Kiba asked, his hand resting near his sword. "Why risk everything for us?"
"Because you are my friends," Ariel said simply, meeting Kiba's gaze. "And because my only rule is to intervene against the forces of tyranny and bullying. Riser was a bully using his status. I will always stand against that. I consider all of you dear friends, and I won't lie to you about who I am or what I can do anymore."
Conversation 2: The Training Invitation (The Open Door)
The Peerage absorbed the shocking revelation. Koneko, ever direct, spoke first.
"So, you're human, but you trained to be... better than devils?"
"In certain aspects, yes," Ariel admitted. "But I still lack the raw power of a High-Class Devil. I can only succeed through efficiency and strategy."
Ariel saw this as the moment to make the pivotal offer—the invitation to share his knowledge, not as a demand, but as an opportunity.
"Here is the reason for the full truth," Ariel continued. "The threats in this world are escalating. Riser was just the beginning. I need to get stronger, and my methods are now moving into areas that will look truly impossible—like hardening my skin to block a sword, or sensing danger before it arrives. I will not hide my training from you anymore."
He took a deep breath. "I don't expect any of you to follow in my footsteps. Your own powers are already immense and based on your ranks. But if any of you are interested in refining your Willpower, your Perception, or your Economy of Motion—the things that helped us win the Rating Game—my training is open to you."
"Wait, you'd share this knowledge?" Issei asked, stunned. "Even the 'Not Burning' secret?"
"I'll teach you the focus drills, Issei," Ariel confirmed with a smile. "They work for the Boosted Gear because it's tied to your soul. I believe I can teach Kiba to stabilize his mind for faster sword generation, and Koneko to make her defense truly absolute. And Kaichou and Akeno-san, I can teach you efficiency that conserves your valuable Demonic energy."
Conversation 3: Asia's Question (The Innocence)
Asia, who had remained quiet, gently raised her hand.
"Ariel-kun, is this training... painful?" she asked, her voice soft.
"Sometimes, very," Ariel admitted honestly. "It requires pushing past what you think is possible. But it's worth it. It gives you control over your own existence."
Asia nodded thoughtfully. "I don't think I can do the painful physical training, but... my Sacred Gear is about healing, and my role is Bishop. Is there anything you could teach me that would make my healing stronger?"
Ariel's \text{MND} \text{ } 2.0 processed the request instantly. "Asia-san, your Gear is tied directly to your pure Will. If you train your Focus (MND/SPR), you can make your healing less exhaustive and more precise. Your training would be purely meditative and mental, not physical. It would make your blessing stronger."
Asia beamed. "Then I would like to join your training, Ariel-kun."
Kiba and Koneko exchanged looks. Issei, fully inspired, pounded his fist. "Then I'm in! Harem King needs to train with the Tactical Genius!"
Rias stood up, looking at Ariel with deep respect. "We accept your offer, Ariel-kun Veritas. This is an incredible risk you are taking, but we accept you as a full, trusted ally. Show us your truth."
📈 Next Step
Ariel has successfully completed Phase 4 (The Full Veritas Revelation), establishing himself as a trusted mentor and ally to the entire ORC.
The immediate next step is to begin the shared training—implementing the One Piece-style hardening/sensing techniques while guiding the Peerage in their individual focus areas. This will begin the transition of the ORC into a tactically superior force.

## 📽️ Phase 4 (Continued): The Window to Another World
Occult Research Clubroom – Thursday Afternoon
Ariel stood before the peerage. He had just explained his name and his motivation, but Rias and Akeno were still struggling with the mechanics of how a human could nullify Riser’s Hellfire.
"You ask how I stopped the fire," Ariel said, his voice steady. "You think of it as magic cancellation. It isn't. It's Authority."
He looked up at the empty air.
"System," Ariel commanded. "Permission to display Archive: World 824 - The Grand Line. Topic: Will Manifestation (Haki)."
> Observer: "Permission Granted. Projection initiating. Showing the source of inspiration for the Mortal Variable's training."
> 
The air in the clubroom shimmered. The walls dissolved, replaced by a high-fidelity holographic projection that surrounded the peerage. They were no longer in Kuoh; they were floating above a vast, tumultuous ocean.
1. The First Lesson: Touching the Untouchable (Armament)
The scene shifted to a chaotic battlefield. A man made entirely of smoke fought a man made of fire. Physical swords passed through them; bullets melted or drifted harmlessly away.
"In this reality," Ariel narrated as the peerage watched in awe, "there are warriors who eat 'Devil Fruits.' Some of them, the Logia types, transform their very bodies into elements—fire, smoke, magma, light. They are untouchable by normal physics."
The projection zoomed in. A dark-skinned man without powers clenched his fist. His arm turned a shiny, metallic black. He punched the man made of Smoke.
CRACK.
The smoke didn't disperse; it solidified. The punch connected. The smoke-man bled.
"This is the first stage," Ariel explained. "They call it Armament. It is the ability to coat your body in your own spiritual armor. It forces reality to solidify. It grabs the 'fluid' body of a ghost or an elemental and forces it to be physical. This is how I grabbed Riser’s fire. I didn't put it out; I forced it to be solid, then I crushed it."
Issei’s eyes were wide. "So... you punch the magic itself?"
"Exactly."
2. The Second Lesson: The Cheat Breaker (Nullification)
The scene shifted rapidly, showing terrifying abilities that defied all logic.
 * Trafalgar Law: A man created a blue dome ("Room"). Inside, he cut a mountain in half with a casual swing. He tried to teleport a massive, grinning Emperor (Kaido). The teleportation failed because the Emperor's Will was too dense.
 * Magellan: A massive warden unleashed a hydra of purple poison that melted stone. A warrior clad in Will blocked it, the poison sliding off the invisible armor without touching the skin.
 * Akainu: A fleet admiral rained magma fists that boiled the sea. A one-armed man stopped the magma punch with a single sword, his Will completely neutralizing the heat.
"This is the second stage," Ariel continued. "In that world, there are 'Cheat' abilities. Instant death poison. Teleportation rooms. Magma that burns anything. But a sufficiently powerful Will can Nullify the cheat."
The scene shifted to a dark, ancient battlefield. A warrior wielding dual axes (Scopper Gaban) was fighting a silhouette radiating divine light (God's Knight). The Knight struck with a power that granted invincibility—a shimmering shield that nothing could break.
Gaban didn't use magic. He focused his Will into a singular point on his axe. He struck. The invincibility shattered like glass.
"Even Invincibility and Immortality are just systems," Ariel said, looking at Rias. "Riser is immortal because the 'system' heals him. If your Will is stronger than the system, you can deny the healing. That is Nullification Intent."
3. The Third Lesson: The Legends (The Authority)
The projection shifted one last time. The atmosphere became heavy, crushing.
Giant figures appeared—men who stood like mountains.
 * Gold Roger and Whitebeard clashing weapons, the sky splitting above them without their blades even touching.
 * Monkey D. Garp throwing cannonballs like baseballs with bare hands.
 * Kaido and Big Mom screaming, their voices alone shattering stone.
"These are the Legends," Ariel said, his voice filled with a mix of respect and longing. "Rocks. Roger. Newgate. Garp. Sengoku. To them, this power isn't a special technique. It is as natural as breathing."
The projection showed Kaido swinging a club. The weapon was coated in jagged black lightning. It wasn't electricity; it was his sheer, domineering Will leaking out of the weapon. When it hit, it didn't just hurt the body; it crushed the opponent's spirit, debuffing them, making them weak and afraid.
"This is the ultimate goal: Conqueror's Will," Ariel whispered. "They clad their attacks in their own Authority. They impose their reality on the world. They don't just hit you; they command you to fall."
The Summary
The hologram faded, returning them to the quiet clubroom. The silence was deafening.
Ariel turned to his friends.
"To those Legends, what I did against Riser is basic. It's the entry requirement to their world. That is the standard I am chasing."
He looked at Issei, Kiba, and Koneko.
"I can't give you Devil Fruits. But I can teach you the Intent.
 * Issei: Your Boosted Gear responds to Will. If you learn to clad your arm in your Will, you can punch through magic defenses.
 * Koneko: If you learn Armament, your defense becomes absolute. Poison, fire, acid—nothing touches your skin.
 * Kiba: If you learn to project your Will into your sword, you can cut things that have no physical form... like ghosts, or light."
Rias let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. "And you... you are trying to reach the level of those monsters? As a human?"
"I'm trying," Ariel smiled, the tension breaking. "I'm still at level one compared to them. But the view from the top looks nice."
Issei stood up, his face set in stone.
"Teach me. I want to punch through magic."
Kiba gripped his sword hilt. "To cut the intangible... yes. I need this."
Ariel nodded. "Then we begin. Welcome to the grind."
📈 Strategic Shift
The ORC now understands the Concept (Will > System) without needing to learn the specific One Piece terminology (Haki). They view Ariel not just as a tactician, but as a pioneer bringing "Legendary Arts" from another dimension.
Your move:
The training alliance is formed. Do you want to detail:
 * The First Shared Session: Ariel teaches the basics of "Armoring the Mind" (Armament) to Koneko and Issei, focusing on physical durability.
 * Ariel's Solo Progress: Ariel returns to the PTD to begin the actual One Piece Hardening Training (being beaten with bamboo swords/blunt objects) to push his \text{PHY} to 2.5.

## 👁️ Phase 4 (Continued): The Art of Sensing the Future
Occult Research Clubroom – The PTD Projection
The atmosphere in the room had shifted from curiosity to heavy anticipation. Ariel stood in the center of the room, stretching his neck.
"Hardening the body is useful," Ariel addressed the group. "But the best defense is not being there when the attack lands. In that other world, this is called Observation (Kenbunshoku). It is the ability to hear the 'voice' of living things and, eventually, to see the future."
He waved his hand. "System. Archive: World 824. Topic: Sensory Mastery. Play the three levels of ascent."
1. The Inspiration: The Dark King’s Lesson
The hologram shifted to a dense jungle. An old man with silver hair and glasses (Silvers Rayleigh) stood before a young, blindfolded boy (Luffy).
"Watch," Ariel commanded.
The old man moved with terrifying speed, swinging a heavy wooden staff.
Whack. The boy got hit.
Whack. Hit again.
"He isn't trying to hear the wind or the footsteps," Ariel explained as the boy struggled. "He is trying to feel the Intent of the attacker. Living things emit a signal before they move. The will to strike exists milliseconds before the muscle contracts."
Suddenly, on screen, the boy tilted his head. The staff swung through empty air.
"There," Kiba whispered, eyes wide. "He dodged before the swing was fully committed."
2. The Inspiration: The Man Who Sees the Future
The scene shifted violently. A mirrored dimension. Two fighters clash.
One is a massive man with a scarf (Katakuri). His eyes glow red.
"This man," Ariel said, his voice grim, "has trained his Observation so deeply he doesn't just sense intent. He sees seconds into the future."
The peerage watched in horror.
Luffy threw a punch. Katakuri shifted his body into a donut shape before the punch arrived, letting the fist pass harmlessly through a hole in his torso.
"He isn't dodging," Issei stammered. "He's... reshaping his body around an attack that hasn't happened yet."
"Exactly," Ariel nodded. "It looks like invincibility. But it's just absolute knowledge. This is the wall the hero had to climb."
3. The Inspiration: The Natural State
The scene shifted to the legends again. Whitebeard sleeping, hooked up to medical machines. An assassin tried to attack him in his sleep. Without waking up, without opening his eyes, Whitebeard sent the assassin flying.
"For the Legends," Ariel said quietly, "the 'Future' is just part of the 'Present.' They don't turn this ability on. It is their natural state of existence. They are never surprised. They are never caught off guard. That is the goal."
⚔️ The Live Demonstration: The PTD Gauntlet
The hologram faded, leaving only the sterile white grid of the PTD surrounding Ariel. The Peerage was now watching a live feed of Ariel's consciousness inside the simulation.
"Now," Ariel said, pulling a thick black cloth from his pocket. "I try to climb the first wall."
He tied the blindfold tight. Darkness took him.
> Observer: "Scenario: Rayleigh's Gauntlet. Threat: Dark King Rayleigh (Simulated). Weapon: Hardened Oak Staff. Speed: Variable. Goal: Dodge 100 consecutive strikes. Current Mastery: MND 2.0 / SPR 1.4."
> 
Ariel stood alone in the void. A digital reconstruction of Rayleigh shimmered into existence, holding the staff.
Rias watched, her hands gripping the back of a chair. "He's fighting a simulation of a legend... blind?"
The Struggle (0 - 20 Strikes)
Rayleigh moved.
CRACK.
The staff slammed into Ariel’s shoulder. Ariel grunted, stumbling back.
CRACK.
A sweep to the legs. Ariel hit the floor.
"Too slow," Ariel muttered to himself, standing up. "Stop listening. Stop thinking with the brain."
He focused his MND 2.0 inward. He stopped trying to calculate the trajectory (Tactics) and tried to switch to SPR 1.4 (Sensing the Will).
Whoosh.
The staff swung for his head. Ariel ducked.
The Peerage gasped.
Whoosh.
Ariel side-stepped.
"He's doing it," Akeno whispered. "He's sensing the energy signature of the construct."
The Rhythm (21 - 60 Strikes)
Rayleigh increased the speed. The attacks became a blur.
Ariel entered a flow state. He wasn't seeing the staff; he was seeing a jagged red spike of "Harmful Intent" appearing in the darkness of his mind just before the physical blow came.
Dodge left. Duck. Pivot. Jump.
He was moving like water. His PHY 2.0 allowed him to execute the movements his mind was seeing. For a moment, he looked untouchable—a true Silhouette.
The Overload (61 - 100 Strikes)
"Speed Level: High," the Observer announced.
Rayleigh vanished. He wasn't walking anymore; he was flashing.
Ariel’s brow furrowed. The "red spikes" were appearing too fast. They were overlapping.
Crack!
He took a hit to the ribs. His concentration wavered.
Crack!
A hit to the knee.
Crack! Whack. Thud.
The rhythm broke. Ariel was getting battered. He tried to regain the sense, but the pain was flooding his MND, creating noise. He managed to dodge a few desperate swings, but he was mostly just tanking the hits with his new PHY 2.0 durability.
Strike 100.
Rayleigh delivered a final, overhead smash. Ariel, exhausted and bruised, sensed it too late. He crossed his arms to block (Armament style) instead of dodging.
BAM.
The force sent him skidding back ten meters.
> Observer: "Simulation Complete. Dodged: 64/100. Status: Failure. You rely too much on logic (MND) when the pace increases. You must surrender fully to Intuition (SPR)."
> 
Ariel ripped the blindfold off, breathing heavily. He was covered in digital bruises that would fade in the real world but the pain phantom lingered.
He looked at the Peerage. They weren't looking at his failure. They were looking at the 64 times he moved like a ghost.
"I'm not there yet," Ariel said, wiping sweat from his eyes. "My brain is too loud. I think too much about 'where' the attack is, instead of just 'knowing' it's there. But... that's the training."
Issei looked at Ariel, then at his own hands.
"You dodged a ghost sixty times without seeing him," Issei said, shaking his head in disbelief. "If I could do that... Riser wouldn't have touched me at all."
Kiba stepped forward, his eyes burning with the intensity of a swordsman.
"The ability to sense the intent before the blade moves... Ariel-kun, that is the ultimate state of the sword. I need to learn this."
Ariel smiled, wincing slightly as he rubbed his bruised shoulder.
"Then grab a blindfold, Kiba. It's going to hurt."
📈 Training Progress
Ariel has demonstrated the path. He is competent but not a master, maintaining the "Struggling Mortal" spice while showing elite potential.
Current Status:
 * Observation Haki: Level 1 (Intent Sensing) - Unlocked but unstable under high-speed pressure.
 * Future Sight: Locked (Requires much higher stats).

## 🌌 Phase 4 (Conclusion): The Library of Legends
Occult Research Clubroom – Moments Later
Ariel caught his breath, the digital bruises from the Rayleigh simulation fading. He looked around at the stunned faces of the Peerage. They were still processing the concept of "Haki" and the image of the Pirate King splitting the sky.
"I showed you that reality first," Ariel said, gesturing to the fading hologram of the Grand Line, "because it’s my current favorite. The 'Silhouettes' in that world—Rocks, Roger, Garp—they capture the feeling of being a legend perfectly. But..."
He straightened up, his expression shifting from exhaustion to a deep, burning passion.
"...that isn't the only mountain I'm climbing. To understand what I am, you need to see the rest of the library."
Ariel raised his hand. "System. Archive: Multi-Verse Overview. Rapid Projection."
The room darkened. Multiple screens flared into existence around them, surrounding the Peerage in a kaleidoscope of different worlds.
1. The Foundation: The Soldier (MGS & Manhwa)
Ariel pointed to a gritty, realistic screen on the left. It showed a man with an eyepatch in a jungle, and modern soldiers in sleek suits moving with terrifying efficiency.
"Before I could even think about magic, I had to master the body. You asked Rias-kaichou how I knew about CQC and infiltration? I lived the lives of the God of Blackfield, the Mercenary Enrollment Numbers, and the Big Boss of the Metal Gear Saga."
Rias watched a projection of Big Boss disarming three soldiers in under a second. "So this is the source of your tactical insight?"
"Yes. They are humans with no magic who became myths on the battlefield. That was my entry level. I had to become the best soldier before I could try to be a warrior."
2. The Current Struggle: The Broken God (Mori Dan)
Ariel pointed to a screen showing a young man with messy hair, his body covered in scars, fighting gods with just kicks.
"Right now, I feel most like him. Mori Dan from God of High School."
The projection showed Mori Dan fighting against opponents with overwhelming magical powers, using a technique called Recoilless Kick to bend space without magic.
"He was once the Heavenly Emperor—a God—but his power was sealed, and his body was broken. He had to rely entirely on martial arts to fight entities capable of destroying worlds. That is me right now. I am the Mortal Variable trying to kick down the door of the Supernatural."
Kiba watched Mori Dan's movements intently. "Efficiency... forcing the world to bend to physical technique. I see."
3. The Aspirations: The Overlord and The Chaos (Bleach & Fairy Tail)
Ariel waved his hand, bringing two terrifying images to the forefront.
One showed a man in white (Aizen Sousuke) stopping a massive, magical bankai sword with a single index finger. The music shifted to a choir of treachery and transcendence.
"I don't agree with his evil methods," Ariel stated firmly. "But Aizen Sousuke... his aspiration to stand above heaven, to transcend both Hollows and Soul Reapers... that drive is beautiful. Look at him. He stops a blade capable of destroying a city with one finger. Not because of a spell, but because his Spiritual Pressure—his Presence—is just that much denser."
Issei gulped. "He stopped it with a finger?! That's the level you want?"
"Higher," Ariel smiled.
He pointed to the next screen: A human transforming into a black dragon (Acnologia).
"And him. Acnologia. The Dragon King. In a war between Dragons and Humans, he was the Third Variable. He destroyed both sides to end the war. He didn't join a faction; he was the faction. That is the definition of the Silhouette. Uncontrollable. Absolute."
4. The Heavenly Demon (The Manhwas)
A flurry of images flashed—warriors in ancient robes radiating distinct, dark, overwhelming auras. The Heavenly Demon.
"In the Murim worlds, there are those who reach the peak of Cultivation. They don't just fight; they overwhelm. I want that 'Heavenly' pressure. I want to be able to end a fight just by walking into the room."
5. The Ultimate Goal: The Gods (Dragon Ball Super)
Finally, Ariel commanded the center screen to expand. It showed beings that made the others look small.
A warrior with spiky hair turning silver (Goku - Ultra Instinct).
A purple cat deity destroying half a planet with a tap of his fingernail (Beerus).
An angel with blue skin holding a staff, smiling calmly while moving through time (Whis).
"And this..." Ariel’s voice dropped to a whisper of pure reverence. "...is the summit. Dragon Ball Super."
The Peerage watched Beerus (Bills) fight. It wasn't a fight; it was erasure.
They watched Whis dodge attacks automatically, his body moving without thought.
"Goku. Vegeta. The Gods of Destruction like Bills. The Angels like Whiz. They exist on a level where universes are fragile as glass. They don't use tricks. They use pure, condensed Power and Godly Technique."
Ariel turned off the projection. The room returned to normal, but the silence was heavy.
"That is why I train," Ariel said, looking at his friends. "I am currently at the level of a strong soldier (MGS). I am reaching for the level of a Haki user (One Piece). But one day... I want to stand there."
He pointed at the ceiling.
"I want to be the Mortal who became a God of Destruction through push-ups and willpower."
He looked at Rias, Akeno, Kiba, Koneko, Issei, and Asia.
"I'm not asking you to follow me all the way there. It's a path of pain, and you have your own responsibilities as Devils. But if you want to borrow from the Tactics of Big Boss, the Defense of One Piece, or the Focus of the Heavenly Demon... my library is open."
Rias let out a long, shaky breath. She looked at Ariel with a mixture of terror and absolute trust.
"You are a greedy human, Ariel Veritas," she said, a smile tugging at her lips. "Aiming for the seat of Gods."
"Why aim for the ceiling," Ariel grinned, his friendly face returning, "when there's a whole sky up there?"
[The Mortal Variable's path was set. And for the first time, he wasn't walking it alone.]
This concludes the "Veritas Vacation" Demo.
