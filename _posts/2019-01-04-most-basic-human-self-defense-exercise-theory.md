Within the title, the basics is further deduced into the most basics like breathing, feeling, walking, and running. There is theory word in the title meaning that we should be aware, able to comprehend, and able to explain the exercises even as simple as the mechanics behind walking. This is my comprehension of self defense starting from my obese physical condition after falling from my peak condition is martial arts. Therefore, I can now relate how less physically gifted people have trouble in fighting. This theory is suited for those who does not have any knowledge and experience about fighting. Also, this theory is more suited for those who have an emergency to learn about self defense. This theory is designed to equip regular people to immediately use self defense. Finally, this theory is primarily for self esteem rather than existing advanced and complicated exercises where not everyone can do while the exercises here is everyone can do unless you have disabilities.
