**Grandma:** Sonny, who put more coins in my chest?

**Grandson:** Nobody did grandma since the first time Sonny gave those coins.

**Grandma:** That's funny, maybe Grandma's getting senile? Grandma remembered it was not full.

**Grandson:** Wait Grandma, let me check. Oh the price is above $1 for the whole week. You are not senile Grandma, you are supposed to have more coins now.

**Grandma:** Are you saying the coin multiplied by itself?! What kind of coin make babies?

**Grandson:** It is called [Ampleforth](https://www.ampleforth.org/) Grandma. The price is above $1 which means more people demands more coins. So Lord Ampleforth supplied us more coins to sell to them Grandma!

**Grandma:** Then let's go to the market and sell to them Sonny!

**Grandma:** Sonny, did a thief broke into the house!?

**Grandson:** The security guard saw nobody entered the house Grandma.

**Grandma:** Then why are there less coins?

**Grandson:** let me check again. Oh, the price is below $1 which means there is too much coins and less people demands them. So Lord Ampleforth reduced our supply.

**Grandma:** Sonny! Will my coins disappear one day?!

**Grandson:** Don't worry Grandma, no matter how far the price drops, Lord Ampleforth will only take at most 10% each day (Rebase % = (((Oracle Rate - Price Target) / Price Target) * 100) / 10). For every 10 coins Grandma have, Lord Ampleforth will only take 1.

**Grandma:** Still, why is Lord Ampleforth so stingy?

**Grandson:** To create more scarcity Grandma so that people pays attention to it and demands will rise again!
