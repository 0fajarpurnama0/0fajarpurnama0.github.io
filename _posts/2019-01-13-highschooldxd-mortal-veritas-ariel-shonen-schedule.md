Ariel Shonen are by Fajar Purnama and Gemini Pro AI

## Day 1 (Monday): The Operator and The Heist
### Morning: The Virtual Gym (Module 1-4 & 14)
Time: 5:00 AM.
#### Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
Ariel woke up. He didn't groan about school; he checked his imaginary HUD.
Ariel: "Day 1. Stats are garbage. Let's fix that."
He closed his eyes. [Command: Enter PTD].
The room dissolved into a grey, wireframe grid.
Time Dilation: 1 Hour Real = 2 Hours Sim. (Low Level).
Scenario: Standard Gym.
Ariel spawned weights, pull-up bars, and a treadmill.
[Module 14: Muscle Training]
He didn't just lift; he analyzed.
Ariel: "Pectoral engagement low. Adjust angle."
He did 200 virtual pushups. His real body twitched on the bed, firing the neural pathways. The brain was learning the strain, even if the muscle wasn't tearing yet.
[Module 3: Daily Movement]
He practiced Tactical Walking (Solid Snake style). Rolling the feet. Lowering the silhouette.
Ariel: "If I walk like a civilian, I die like a civilian."
He exited the PTD at 6:30 AM, sweating mentally. He grabbed a protein shake and ran to meet Issei.
The Commute:
Issei was dragging his feet.
Issei: "Monday... why..."
Ariel: "Pick up the pace, Issei! The morning air is full of nitrogen! Good for the lungs! Race you to the gate!"
Issei: "You have too much energy, dude!"
School: The Silent Processor (Module 7 & 8)
#### Location: Class 2-B.
The teacher droned on about history. Issei was asleep.
Ariel sat upright, posture perfect.
[Module 8: Empty Mind]
He visualized a trash can. Every word the teacher said that wasn't on the test went into the bin. Every relevant fact was filed.
Efficiency.
[Module 7: Awareness]
He scanned his own body.
Pulse: 65. Left calf tight. Spine curved 2 degrees.
He micro-adjusted his seating position to optimize blood flow. He was training his nervous system to be hyper-aware of his own biology.
### Lunch: The War Room (Social)
Location: The Cafeteria.
The Perverted Quartet assembled.
Matsuda: "Target acquired. Kendo Club. Changing Room. 3:45 PM."
Ren (Route B) would have sighed and pointed out the flaws.
Ariel (Route A) grinned. He pulled out a napkin and a pen.
Ariel: "Gentlemen, this isn't a peep. This is a Black Ops Extraction of Visual Data."
He drew a diagram.
Ariel: "Matsuda, you're Bravo Team. Create a diversion near the vending machines. Motohama, you're Charlie Team. Watch for the Student Council. Issei, you're Alpha. We take the vents."
Issei: "Vents? Like in the movies?"
Ariel: "Like in Metal Gear. Low noise discipline. Hand signals only. If we get caught, disavow all knowledge."
Issei: "Yes sir! Operator Ariel!"
Ariel didn't care about the girls. He cared about the Mission Success Rate.
### Afternoon: The Heist (Event)
#### Location: Behind the Gymnasium.
The operation commenced.
Ariel moved with [Module 12: Stealth (Basic)]. He moved quietly, placing his feet carefully.
Issei... tried. He stepped on a twig. CRACK.
Ariel: (Whispering) "Contact front!"
A shadow fell over them.
Koneko Toujou stood on the fence.
Koneko: "Scum."
Matsuda and Motohama fled. Issei froze.
Ariel stood up. He didn't feel shame; he felt Tactical Failure.
Ariel: "Ambush. We were flanked."
Koneko jumped down. She threw a punch at Issei.
Issei took it in the gut. "Guh!"
She turned to Ariel.
Ariel: "Physical confrontation inevitable."
He raised his guard. [Module 10: Basic Stance].
He tried to parry.
WHAM.
Koneko’s fist hit his arms. The force was like a hydraulic press. Ariel was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall.
Status: Bruised forearms. Winded.
Koneko: "Don't come back."
Ariel's Analysis:
He slid down the wall. He wasn't crying. He was calculating.
Ariel: "That wasn't muscle. That was... density? Physics doesn't support a girl of her mass generating that force. Supernatural variable confirmed."
### Evening: The Urban Free-Run (Module 13 & 17)
#### Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).
He went home. He was sore, but excited.
Ariel: "I lost because I was stationary. I need verticality."
[Command: Enter PTD]
Scenario: Urban Rooftops (Mirror's Edge).
[Module 13: Open World Movement] + [Module 17: Acrobatics]
Ariel ran through the simulation.
Jump.
He missed the ledge. Fell 20 stories. SPLAT.
[System Error: User Death. Resetting.]
He woke up with a headache.
Ariel: "Again."
Run. Vault. Roll.
He practiced the Parkour Roll to absorb impact.
He practiced the Wall Run to gain height.
He spent 4 hours (Simulated) running away from imaginary agents.
Ariel: "Flow. Don't stop. Obstacles are just paths."
### Night: The Integration (Module 7, 8, 9)
Time: 10:00 PM.
He lay in bed. His real body was rested, but his mind remembered the sensation of falling.
[Module 7: Awareness]
He relaxed his muscles one by one.
Release tension. Reset.
[Module 9: Lucid Dream]
Ariel: "Tonight... I replay the Koneko fight. I want to see if I can dodge that punch if I use the wall."
He fell asleep, optimizing his defeat into a lesson.

 * PHY: 1.1 (Virtual conditioning active).

Ariel sat in class.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

### Lunch: The Trade (Social)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

The Quartet gathered. Ariel participated enthusiastically.

**Matsuda:** "Deal! Ariel, you have good taste."
**Issei:** "You guys are obsessed."
**Ariel:** "It's not obsession, Issei. It's **Asset Collection**."

He treated the magazines like rare loot drops. It kept the "Pervert" cover intact while actually just being a way to bond.

### Afternoon: The Escape (Event)

**Location:** Behind the Gymnasium.

They were in position again. Ariel was leading.
**Ariel:** "Okay. Koneko patrols the perimeter. We have a 30-second window."

Suddenly, **Koneko** dropped from the roof.

Issei froze. "Not again!"

Ariel didn't freeze. He didn't try to talk (like Ren).

**[Module 12: Stealth Escape]**
Ariel dropped a handful of dust (pocket sand) to create a visual distraction.
He vaulted over the fence using **[Module 13: Parkour]**.
He rolled into the bushes and went silent. **[Module 18: Breath Control]**.

Koneko punched Issei. *Whack.*
She looked around for Ariel. She sniffed the air.
**Koneko:** "Gone?"

A horde of delinquents surrounded him. They didn't use karate; they used haymakers, headbutts, and tackles.

* **Move 2:** Another grabbed him. Ariel stomped on his foot and elbowed his face. **(Dirty Fighting)**.
* **Move 3:** Ariel practiced the **"Bully" Takedown**. Tackle the legs, mount, and ground-and-pound.

He used the jungle gym.
*Vault.* He cleared the bars.
*Swing.* He used momentum to launch himself.
*Roll.* He hit the sand and came up running.

**Ariel:** "Agility isn't speed. It's control. If I fall, I turn it into a roll. If I jump, I land running."
He practiced **backflips** not to show off, but to evade a sweeping leg kick.
*Ariel:* "Create distance. Reset the engagement."

### School: The Spark (Module 7, 8, 20-Attempt)

**Location:** Class 2-B. History.

Issei was drooling on his desk.
Ariel sat in **[Module 8: Empty Mind]**.
He was bored with "Human Stats." He wanted the upgrade.

**[Module 20: Inner Energy (Attempt)]**
He focused on his core.
*Ariel:* "Ren (Route B) found the Void. I need to find the **Flow**."
He visualized his blood as energy. He tried to heat it up.

He stabbed the soft spot under the chin (simulated non-lethal, just pressure).

The Quartet gathered.
**Matsuda:** "The pool plan is solid. But we need a lookout."

**Ariel:** (Smiling) "I'll do it. But we need contingencies. If the Student Council patrols, we need an exit route."
He drew a map on a napkin.
**Ariel:** "Motohama, you watch the East Gate. If you see Tsubaki, you cough loudly. That's the signal to scatter."

**Issei:** "You treat peeping like a military operation, dude."
**Ariel:** "Because getting caught is a tactical failure, Issei. We aim for success."

### Afternoon: The Digital Battlefield (Arcade Event)

**Location:** SEGA Arcade. 3:30 PM.

The boys hit the arcade.

He watched Issei's hands.
*Issei twitched.*
Ariel blocked low. Punished.
**Ariel:** "You telegraph your inputs, Issei. You hold your breath before a super."

**Issei:** "Stop reading my mind!"
**Ariel:** "I'm reading your body language. In a real fight, that gets you killed."

*O-Goshi (Hip Throw).*
He used her momentum to slam her into the digital floor.
**Ariel:** "Gravity is the ultimate weapon."
* **Drill 2 (The Disarm):**
She drew a knife. Ariel caught her wrist, twisted the thumb joint, and stripped the weapon.

**Ariel:** "The weapon is now mine."

He practiced until the movements were automatic. He wasn't thinking; his body was reacting to kinetic energy.

### School: The Flyer (Event)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was walking to his desk. A girl in a uniform handed him a flyer.
**Girl:** "Need a wish granted?"
**Issei:** "Huh? Weird."
He stuffed it in his pocket.

Ariel sat in the back.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He felt a *prickle*.

When it was his turn, he sang a perfect, somber ballad (*Baka Mitai*).

*Ariel:* "Smooth is fast."
* **Drill 2 (Trajectory):**
He fired a handgun. He watched the bullet path.
**Ariel:** "A bullet travels in a straight line, affected by gravity and wind. Magic projectiles (Light Spears) likely follow similar physics but with higher velocity."
He practiced **dodging** simulated gunfire.

Ariel woke up in a Soviet jungle. He wasn't playing a game; he *was* Naked Snake.
The air was humid. The mud was wet.

* *Ariel:* "Become the grass. Become the mud."

**2. The End (Patience):**
He fought the legendary sniper, **The End**.
He lay in the mud for 4 simulated hours (2 real hours). He slowed his heart rate to mask his thermal signature.

**2. Gray Fox (The Speed Check):**
He fought the Cyborg Ninja in the lab.

The psychic tried to read his mind.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

### Afternoon: The Old War (MGS4 - Guns of the Patriots)

**Time:** 4:00 PM (Real Time).
**Scenario:** *The War Economy.*

Ariel’s avatar aged. He was **Old Snake**. His back hurt. His stamina bar was short.
**Lesson:** Fighting when the body is broken.

**1. The Microwave Hall (The Willpower Test):**
This was the climax of the training.
Ariel had to walk through a hallway of microwave radiation.
His PTD simulated the pain—the feeling of his skin cooking, his nerves firing, his muscles failing.
He crawled. He dragged himself.
**[Module 22: Will / Intent]**
*Ariel:* "Don't stop. Don't stop. If I stop, everyone dies."

Ariel built a base. He managed resources. He extracted soldiers via Fulton balloon.
**Lesson:** **Logistics.**

He realized he couldn't do everything alone. He needed Rias. He needed the Club.

### Night: The Debriefing (Module 7)

**Time:** 10:00 PM (Real Time).
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel disconnected.
He gasped, sitting up in bed. His real body hadn't moved, but his brain felt like it had lived three lifetimes. He was drenched in sweat from the psychosomatic stress.

**Status Check:**

* **Muscle Memory:** Upgraded. He felt like he knew how to hold a knife in 15 different ways.
* **Mental State:** Hardened. He had "lived" through betrayal, war, and sacrifice.

**Ariel:** "Big Boss was just a man. Solid Snake was just a clone. They killed superweapons with nothing but skills and cigarettes."

He looked at his hands.
**Ariel:** "I am the flesh and blood. And I will take down the supernatural."

He slept, not needing a lucid dream tonight. He had lived enough dreams for one day.

Ariel didn't train physically. His muscles needed to knit after the MGS marathon.
He sat at his desk, surrounded by his "Sacred Texts"—manga volumes, light novels, and downloaded lore.

**1. Dragon Ball (The Ceiling):**
He flipped through the Saiyan Saga.
*Ariel:* "Krillin and Tien. They stood on the same battlefield as Nappa and Vegeta. They died, yes. But they fought. They used **Ki** to bridge the biological gap."
*Takeaway:* "Ki Control" is the prerequisite for relevance. Without energy projection, I am just a target.

**2. One Piece (The Equalizer):**
He watched a clip of **Vergo** vs. Smoker.
*Ariel:* "Armament Haki. It makes the body harder than steel. It allows a human to hit smoke."
*Takeaway:* This is the solution to the **Logia Problem** (Riser's Fire). If I can learn to coat my skin in **Will**, I can punch the Phoenix.

**3. Naruto & Bleach (The Flow):**
He reviewed Chakra control (Tree Climbing) and Reiatsu (Spiritual Pressure).
*Ariel:* "It's all about adhesion and projection. Sticking to walls. Crushing the air with presence."

**4. Wuxia / Murim (The Mechanics):**
He opened a web novel app (*Nano Machine / Return of the Mount Hua Sect*).
He studied the diagrams of **Meridians** and **Dantians**.
*Ariel:* "This is the manual. Dragon Ball tells me *what* to do (Blast). Wuxia tells me *how* (Circulate Qi from the Dantian through the twelve meridians). I need to clear my blockages."

**Conclusion:**
Ariel closed the books.
**Ariel:** "I have the theory. The PTD gives me the practice. Now I need the **Nerves**."

### Midday: The Mansion of Fear (PTD - Resident Evil 1)

**Time:** 12:00 PM.
**Location:** PTD Interface.
**[Command: Load Scenario - Survival Horror]**
**[Module 6: Fear Training] + [Module 15: Knife]**

Ariel stood in the main hall of the **Spencer Mansion**. The air smelled of dust and rot.
**Objective:** Survive with limited resources.

**The Zombie:**
A zombie turned the corner, groaning.
Ariel’s heart rate spiked to 120 BPM. **[Module 6 Alert]**.
**Ariel:** "It's rotting flesh. Biological hazard. Threat level: Low."

He forced his breathing to slow.
He drew his knife.
**[Module 16: CQC]**
The zombie lunged. Ariel stepped side, grabbed the hair, and drove the knife into the brain stem.
*Squelch.*
**Ariel:** "Disgusting. But effective."

He moved through the mansion. Ammo was scarce. He counted every bullet.
*Ariel:* "1... 2... Headshot."
He learned **Trigger Discipline** under stress.

### Afternoon: The Nemesis (PTD - Resident Evil 3)

**Time:** 3:00 PM.
**Scenario:** *Raccoon City Streets.*

**[Module 13: Parkour] + [Module 6: Fear Training]**
Ariel was running. Behind him, a massive bioweapon (**Nemesis**) roared "STARS!" and fired a rocket launcher.

**The Lesson:** **You cannot kill it.**
Ariel realized he couldn't fight Nemesis with a handgun. He had to **Evade**.
*Explosion.*
Ariel rolled, using the blast wave to boost his jump over a barricade.
**Ariel:** "If the enemy is invincible (like Riser), you don't trade blows. You lure them into environmental traps."

He shot a red barrel as Nemesis passed it. *BOOM.*
It slowed the monster down. Ariel escaped.
**Ariel:** "Victory is survival."

### Evening: The Village (PTD - Resident Evil 4)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Scenario:** *The Pueblo.*

**[Module 19: Firearms & Martial Arts Synthesis]**
Ariel stood in the village square. A crowd of Ganados (infected villagers) swarmed him.
**Ariel:** "Crowd control."

He channeled **Leon S. Kennedy**.

* *Shot* to the kneecap (Stun).
* *Sprint* in.
* **Roundhouse Kick** to the head. (Area of Effect knockback).

He practiced switching between **Gun** and **Knife** instantly.

* *Parry* a thrown axe with the knife.
* *Shoot* the thrower.
* *Suplex* the enemy behind him.

**Ariel:** "This is the flow. Gun for range. Body for impact. Never stop moving."

He fought the **Chainsaw Man**.
The sound of the revving motor tested his **Module 6**.
*Ariel:* "Don't panic. Watch the blade."
He baited the swing, stepped inside, and shotgunned the enemy point-blank.

### Night: The Reality Check (Module 7 & 8)

**Time:** 10:00 PM. (Real World).
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

Ariel disconnected. He was mentally drained. He felt like he had been running from monsters for 10 hours.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
His hands were steady. The horror didn't shake him anymore. A zombie was just a target. A Tyrant was just a puzzle.

**Ariel:** "If Raynare shows her true form... I won't freeze. I've seen worse."

He sat on his bed.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**
He flushed the violence from his mind. He visualized the Wuxia meridian chart again.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow is Week 2. The Bridge. I need to be ready to warn Issei."

He slept, his dreams silent and orderly.

## Day 8 (Monday): The Honey Pot and The Weapon Master

### Morning: The Bridge (Event)

**Time:** 7:30 AM.
**Location:** The Pedestrian Bridge.

Ariel and Issei were walking to school. Issei was complaining about math. Ariel was practicing **[Module 7: Rhythmic Breathing]**.

A girl was waiting. **Yuuma Amano** (Raynare).
She stepped forward, blushing.
**Yuuma:** "Um... excuse me. Are you Hyoudou Issei?"

Issei pointed at himself. "Me? Yeah?"

**Yuuma:** "Will you... go out with me?"

Issei froze. His brain short-circuited. "Y-YES! I WOULD LOVE TO!"

**Ariel’s Internal Monologue (No Plot Knowledge):**
*Analysis:*

1. *Subject:* Female, attractive, approx. 16 years old.
2. *Target:* Issei, unpopular, known pervert.
3. *Probability:* 0.01%.
*Conclusion:* **Honey Pot.** This is a trap. She is either selling something, recruiting for a cult, or this is a bullying prank.

Ariel stepped in. He didn't use "Killing Intent" (like Ren). He used **Social Engineering**.
**Ariel:** "Hi. I'm his manager. Before he signs anything, are you selling Amway? Or is this for a YouTube prank channel? I need to see the camera crew."

**Yuuma:** (Blinking, confused) "No! I just... saw him around school! I think he's... interesting!"

**Ariel:** "Interesting. Okay. Just so you know, he has no money. If you're kidnapping him for ransom, his parents are middle class."

**Issei:** "Ariel! Stop ruining my life! She likes me!"

Issei shoved Ariel aside, heart-eyes fully activated. Ariel sighed.
**Ariel:** "Alright. But keep your phone on. And send me your GPS location."

### School: The Investigation (Social)

**Location:** The Cafeteria.

Issei was bragging to Matsuda and Motohama.
**Issei:** "She held my hand! It was soft!"
**Matsuda:** "Lies! Deception! You paid her!"

Ariel sat with his bento. He wasn't celebrating. He was thinking.
**[Module 5: Image Training / Deduction]**
*Ariel:* "Her body language was rehearsed. She tilted her head at the exact angle to look cute. She leaned in to invade his space. It’s classic manipulation."

He decided to prep for a **Rescue Mission**.
**Ariel:** "If she leads him to an alleyway to mug him, I need to be ready to jump in."

### Afternoon: The Departure (Event)

**Location:** School Gates.

Issei ran off early.
**Issei:** "I gotta pick an outfit! See ya, Ariel! Don't wait up!"

Ariel watched him go.
**Ariel:** "Don't die of embarrassment, Issei."

Ariel walked home alone. The unease in his gut wasn't "Supernatural Sense" yet. It was just the instinct of a guy who played too many spy games.
**Ariel:** "If Issei gets jumped, I'll need something better than my fists."

**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

He thought about Issei and Yuuma.
**Ariel:** "Sunday. The date is Sunday. I have 6 days to prepare for a mugging."

**Ariel:** "If they grab him after school, they'll drag him here. Or here."

### School: The Daydreamer (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was useless. He spent the entire day drawing hearts in his notebook.

**Class:** (Laughter).

Ariel sat in the back.

**Ariel:** "Issei. Where is the date happening?"
**Issei:** "The fountain park! Sunday at sunset! It's romantic!"

He planned a recon mission for later in the week.

He grabbed a trash can lid.
*Bash.*
He used it as a shield and a frisbee.

He lay in bed.

He practiced **[Module 22: Will / Intent]**.

**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He cataloged the styles.

* **Mishima:** Power.

* **King:** Control.
* **Eddy:** Flow.

**Ariel:** "I am not a master of one. I am a jack of all trades. And that makes me unpredictable."

**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He settled his mind. Tomorrow was Sunday. The Date.

## Day 14 (Sunday): The Soldier, The Angel, and The Ceiling

### Morning: The Inventory (Module 1, 8, 11)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel sat in the center of his room. His gear was laid out on the floor like a ritual.
**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He breathed slowly. He visualized the "Flow" of combat he learned from the Tekken masters.
*Ariel:* "Mishima power. Kazama defense. Dragunov silence."

**[Module 11: Equipment Check]**
He dressed in tactical civilian gear: dark cargo pants, running shoes, a hoodie reinforced with duct tape on the forearms (poor man’s armor).
He loaded his pockets:

1. **Tactical Flashlight (Strobe).**
2. **Pepper Spray.**
3. **Pocket Sand (Ash/Flour mix).**
4. **Steel Pipe (Concealed in sleeve).**

**Ariel:** "I'm treating this as a Hostage Extraction. Target: Issei Hyoudou. Threat Level: High."

### Midday: The Shadow Detail (Module 12 & 17)

**Location:** The Shopping District.

Ariel tailed the couple.
Issei was laughing, buying crepes. Yuuma was smiling.
**[Module 17: Ninja Awareness]**
Ariel watched Yuuma’s reflection in a shop window.
*Observation:* She checked the sun’s position. She wasn't looking at Issei; she was looking at the clock.
*Ariel:* "She's on a schedule. The hit happens at sunset."

He moved to the park early. He scouted the terrain. He loosened a few cobblestones near the fountain to create tripping hazards. He placed a backup pipe behind the vending machine.
*Ariel:* "Battlefield prep complete."

### Late Afternoon: The Incident (Event)

**Location:** The Park Fountain. Sunset.

Ariel hid behind the vending machine. He popped two **Caffeine Pills** to sharpen his reaction time.
Yuuma led Issei to the fountain.
**Yuuma:** "Issei-kun... would you die for me?"

**Ariel:** "Here we go."

The black wings sprouted. The clothes dissolved into bondage gear. The Light Spear materialized.
Issei froze.

**Ariel's Reaction:**
He didn't freeze. He had played *Resident Evil*. He had fought *Metal Gear*. Monsters were just targets.
**Ariel:** "Contact Front!"

### The Confrontation: Man vs. Myth

**1. The Flashbang Entry**
Raynare raised the spear.
Ariel rolled out from cover. He didn't scream. He threw the **Flashlight** (Strobe Mode ON) right at her face.
*FLASH.*
Raynare flinched, blinded for a second. "Gah! My eyes!"

**2. The Extraction**
Ariel sprinted. **[Module 13: Parkour Dash]**.
He tackled Issei.
**Ariel:** "Move, idiot!"
He shoved Issei behind the fountain wall.

**3. The Engagement (CQC vs. Magic)**
Raynare recovered. "A worm?"
She swooped down, claws extended.
Ariel stood his ground. He drew the **Steel Pipe**.
**[Module 19: Weapons Master - Kendo/Escrima]**

Raynare slashed.
Ariel didn't block; he **Parried**. He struck her wrist with the pipe to deflect the claw.
*CLANG.*
He spun and swung the pipe at her ribs.
*THWACK.*
It connected.
**Raynare:** "Ow! You little..."

She was surprised. He was fast. He was skilled. He fought like a veteran soldier.
But then she stopped playing.

**Raynare:** "Enough."
She flew up, ten meters into the air. Out of reach.
**Ariel:** "Range advantage. Bad."

She summoned a massive **Light Spear**.
**Raynare:** "Parry this."

She threw it.
It wasn't aimed at Ariel. It was aimed at Issei, who was cowering behind the fountain.
Ariel had to intercept.

**4. The Failure (Physics vs. Magic)**
Ariel jumped in front of Issei.
He raised the steel pipe. He braced his body.
**[Module 20 Attempt: Iron Body]**
He tried to channel Ki. He tried to harden his muscles like Garp.
But he hadn't unlocked the PTD's supernatural modules yet. He was just a human bracing against a missile.

*CRASH.*

The Light Spear hit the pipe.
The pipe melted instantly.
The spear continued. It slammed into Ariel’s left shoulder.
*CRUNCH.*
The force shattered his clavicle and humerus. He was blown backward, smashing into Issei.
The spear passed through Ariel's shoulder and pierced Issei’s stomach.

They were pinned together to the concrete.
**Ariel:** "GAAAH!"
**Issei:** (Coughing blood) "Ren... Ariel...?"

### The Aftermath: The Liability

Raynare laughed. "Two birds, one stone."
She flew off, satisfied that the sacred gear possessor was dead.

Ariel was conscious, fighting the shock. He tried to pull the spear out, but his arm was useless.
Then, the Crimson Circle appeared.
**Rias Gremory** arrived.

She looked at the scene.
Issei: Dead.
Ariel: Bleeding out, holding a melted pipe.

She healed them. She resurrected Issei.
Then she stood over Ariel. She looked at his tactical gear. She looked at the traps he set.
**Rias:** "You prepared. You fought."

**Ariel:** (Gritting teeth) "I lost."

**Rias:** "Of course you lost. You are a human fighting a Fallen Angel with a metal stick."
She sighed. It was a sigh of pity.
**Rias:** "You are brave, Ariel. But you are a **Liability**. If you keep trying to fight our wars, you will just be another body I have to bury."

She placed a hand on his forehead.
**Rias:** "I should erase this. For your sake. Go back to being a student. Leave the monsters to us."

**Ariel:** (Slapping her hand away with his good arm) "No."
**Rias:** "Excuse me?"
**Ariel:** "Don't touch my mind. I lost because my hardware was weak. Not my software."

He stood up, swaying.
**Ariel:** "I'm not a liability, Rias. I'm... under-leveled."

Rias looked at him. She saw the fire in his eyes. It wasn't the "Darkness" of Ren. It was the **Stubbornness of a Gamer** who just died to a boss and wants a rematch immediately.
**Rias:** "Fine. Keep your memories. But stay out of the way. Next time, I might not be here to heal you."

She teleported away with Issei.

### Night: The Unlock (The Catalyst)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.
**Time:** 11:00 PM.

Ariel sat on his bed. His arm was healed (magic), but the phantom pain remained.
He looked at the melted steel pipe on his floor.

**Ariel:** "Tactics worked. CQC worked. But she flew. And her weapon melted mine."
He clenched his fist.
**Ariel:** "I hit the Human Ceiling. Solid Snake can't beat Goku. I need an upgrade."

He lay down. He jacked into the **PTD**.
The interface was red. **[System Alert: High Trauma Detected. Adrenaline Levels Critical.]**
**[User Request: Unlock Level 2 Restrictions.]**

Ariel’s mind screamed at the system.
**Ariel:** "I don't want to be a Soldier anymore. I want to be a **Super Soldier**. Give me the Fiction."

**[System Update:]**

* **Time Dilation Increased:** 1 Hour = 1 Day.
* **Library Expansion:** **Unlocked.** (Dragon Ball / One Piece / Wuxia).
* **Objective:** **Break the Human Limit.**

Ariel grinned in the dark.
**Ariel:** "Time to grind."

---

### 📊 Day 14 Stats:

* **PHY:** 1.8 (Broken/Healed).
* **MND:** 6.0 (Combat Data Analyzed: Magic > Steel).
* **TEC:** 7.5 (CQC effective against surprise, failed against power).
* **Status:** **PTD Level 2 Unlocked.** The Mortal Variable enters the supernatural tier.

## Day 14 (Sunday): The Soldier, The Angel, and The Ceiling (Extended Climax)

### Late Afternoon: The Incident (Event)

**Location:** The Park Fountain. Sunset.
**Status:** Ambush Ready.

Ariel hid behind the vending machine. He popped two **Caffeine Pills**. His heart rate climbed to 120 BPM—the optimal zone for combat reflex.
He watched Yuuma transform. The black wings. The bondage gear. The violet light.

**Ariel's Internal Monologue:**
*Target confirmed: Hostile Supernatural Entity.*
*flight capabilities: Confirmed.*
*Energy projection: Confirmed.*
*Survival Probability: < 5%.*
*Mission Objective: Extract the VIP (Issei).*

**Ariel:** "Execute."

### Phase 1: The Breach (Tactical Surprise)

Raynare raised the spear to execute Issei. Issei was frozen in terror.
Ariel didn't run out screaming. He rolled a **Flashbang** (Magnesium Flare taped to a strobe light) onto the pavement between them.

*FLASH.*
A blinding white pulse washed out the sunset.
**Raynare:** "Gah! My eyes!"
She flinched, covering her face with one wing. The Light Spear dissipated as her concentration broke.

**Ariel:** "Move!"
He exploded from cover using **[Module 13: Parkour Sprint]**. He didn't run to fight; he ran to displace.
He tackled Issei with a rugby-style shoulder check, driving him five meters away behind the concrete rim of the fountain.

**Issei:** "Ariel?! What are you—"
**Ariel:** "Stay down. Don't peek."

Ariel vaulted over the fountain wall, putting himself in the open. He drew the **Steel Pipe** from his sleeve and the **Utility Knife** from his belt.
He banged the pipe against the fountain.
*CLANG.*

**Ariel:** "Over here, pigeon."

### Phase 2: The Engagement (CQC vs. Claws)

Raynare lowered her wing. Her eyes were red with irritation.
**Raynare:** "A worm? You interrupted my date."

She swooped down. She didn't use a spear; she used her claws, intending to eviscerate him.
**Speed:** Sub-sonic, but faster than an Olympic sprinter.

**Ariel's Reaction (MND 6.0 - Tactical Processing):**
*She's fast. But she flies in a straight line.*
**[Module 19: Weapons Master - Escrima]**

Ariel waited until she was within 2 meters.
*Step left. Pivot.*
He dodged the claw by inches. The wind pressure cut his cheek.
As she passed, he swung the steel pipe two-handed, aiming for the back of her head.

*CRACK.*

The pipe connected. It felt like hitting a truck tire. Raynare’s head snapped forward, and she crashed into the dirt, tumbling.
**Ariel:** "She has mass. Physics still applies."

He didn't wait. He switched to **[Module 16: CQC]**.
He pinned her wing with his knee. He drove the utility knife toward the unarmored section of her shoulder.
*STAB.*
The blade pierced skin. Purple blood welled up.

**Raynare:** "YOU DARE?!"
She roared. She flared her magical aura. A shockwave of violet energy blasted Ariel off her.
He tucked and rolled, landing on his feet, skidding to a halt.

**Ariel:** "Contact made. Enemy bleeds."

### Phase 3: The Escalation (Magic vs. Tools)

Raynare stood up. She pulled the knife out of her shoulder and crushed it. She wasn't playing anymore.
**Raynare:** "I'm going to peel you."

She flew up, hovering 10 meters in the air.
**Ariel:** "Aerial superiority. Bad."

She summoned three **Light Spears**. She threw them in a spread pattern.
*Zip. Zip. Zip.*

**Ariel:** "Trajectory analysis."
He didn't run away; he ran *forward*, under the arc of the spears.
*Explosion. Explosion. Explosion.*
The spears decimated the ground behind him.

Ariel reached into his pouch. **Pocket Sand (Pepper Mix)**.
He waited for her to dive.
She came down, aiming to grab him.
Ariel threw the powder into the air, creating a choking cloud.
**Raynare:** "Dust? Pathetic!"
She flapped her wings, blowing the cloud away instantly.

**Ariel:** "Damn. Wind mechanics."

She grabbed him by the throat. She lifted him into the air.
**Raynare:** "Caught you."
She squeezed. Ariel’s vision spotted.

**Ariel:** "Not... yet."
He pulled the **Stun Gun / Taser** (bought at the hardware store) from his back pocket. He jammed it into her armpit (unarmored).
*ZAP.*
50,000 volts. It wasn't enough to kill her, but it seized her muscles.
Her grip loosened. Ariel dropped.

### Phase 4: The Sacrifice (The Checkmate)

Ariel landed, gasping. His throat was bruised.
Raynare shook off the paralysis. She was furious now. Her aura was turning the air heavy.

**Raynare:** "I'm done with toys."

She summoned a **Great Light Spear**—massive, glowing, and humming with enough energy to level a building.
She looked at Ariel. Then she looked at the fountain. At Issei.

**Raynare:** "You move well, human. But can you move him?"

She aimed the spear at Issei.
**Ariel:** "Coward!"
**Raynare:** "Winner."

She threw it.

**Ariel's Calculation:**
*Distance to Issei: 5 meters.*
*Spear Speed: High.*
*Issei's Status: Frozen.*
*Option A: Dodge. (Issei dies).*
*Option B: Intercept. (High probability of death).*

Ariel didn't think. He acted. **[Module 13: Burst Speed]**.
He burned every ounce of glycogen in his legs. He launched himself into the path of the projectile.

**Ariel:** "IRON BODY!"
He crossed his arms. He tensed every muscle fiber. He tried to replicate the density of the Tekken masters he studied in the PTD.
*Please, hold.*

*CRASH.*

The Light Spear hit his forearms.
**Reality Check:** Steel melts at 1500°C. Light energy is hotter.
Ariel’s sleeves vaporized. His skin blackened instantly. The force shattered his radius and ulna in both arms.
The spear didn't stop. It plowed through his guard, smashing into his left shoulder, shattering the clavicle.

The momentum carried him backward. He slammed into Issei.
The tip of the spear, dampened by Ariel’s body, pierced through Ariel's back and stabbed into Issei’s stomach.

*THUD.*
They were pinned together to the concrete fountain rim.

**Ariel:** (Coughing blood) "Ghh... blocked... mostly..."
**Issei:** "Ariel...?"

### The Aftermath: The Limit

Raynare laughed, floating above them.
**Raynare:** "A human shield. How noble. How useless."

Ariel tried to lift his arms. They were broken. He tried to stand. His legs were numb from shock.
He looked at Raynare. He wasn't afraid. He was **Frustrated**.

**Ariel's Final Thought:**
*My tactics were perfect. My timing was perfect. My will was perfect.*
*But my body... my body was just meat.*
*Physics lost to Magic.*

The crimson circle appeared. Rias Gremory stepped out.
The cavalry arrived.

---

**Narrative Impact:**
This version emphasizes that Ariel **out-skilled** Raynare for most of the fight. He humiliated her with tactics. He only lost because of the raw stat check (Magic Power vs. Human Durability) at the very end.

This validates his need for the **PTD Upgrade**. He doesn't need to learn *how* to fight; he needs a body that can survive the fight.

## Day 15 (Monday): The Naked King and The Bio-Electric Architect

### Morning: The Dragon’s Surprise (Issei)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence.
**Time:** 6:30 AM.

Issei woke up. He felt something soft and warm pressing against his chest.
He opened his eyes. Crimson hair. Smooth skin.
**Rias Gremory** was sleeping beside him. Naked.

**Issei:** "GYAAAAAH!"

He scrambled backward, falling out of bed with a thud.
**Rias:** (Yawning, stretching elegantly) "Good morning, Issei. A Devil needs to be close to their master to recharge. It’s... efficient."

**Issei:** (Blushing furiously) "Efficient?! It's naked! Wait... yesterday... the park... Raynare..."

**Rias:** "You died. I reincarnated you. You are my Pawn now. Welcome to the Gremory Peerage."

Issei looked at his hand. He felt the pulse of the Dragon.
**Issei:** "I'm... a Devil? And I get to serve you?"
**Rias:** "Yes. Now get dressed. We have school."

### Morning: The System Update (Ariel)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
**Time:** 5:00 AM (Subjective Time Dilation Active).

Ariel woke up in the digital void. His real body was lying in bed, right arm in a sling, left shoulder heavily bandaged from the Light Spear impact.
**[System Alert: PTD Level 2 Unlocked.]**
**[New Module Available: Module 21 (Internal Energy Theory).]**

Ariel opened the file. It wasn't a mystical scroll; it was a biological schematic.
**Ariel:** "Okay, System. How do I fix a shattered clavicle without waiting six weeks?"

**System Voice:** *"Analysis: Life Force (Ki/Qi) is bio-electric energy generated by cellular respiration and mitochondrial activity. Most humans waste 90% of it as heat. Guidance: Redirect waste energy to trauma site."*

A wireframe model of Ariel’s body appeared. It showed the energy leaking off him like steam.
**Ariel:** "It's not magic. It's plumbing."

He focused. The PTD highlighted the exact nerve clusters to stimulate.
*Step 1: Breath Control (Oxygen intake).*
*Step 2: Visualization (Guidance).*
*Step 3: Seal the leak.*

Ariel sat in the void for what felt like hours. He forced the "Steam" of his energy to condense into "Water" and flow toward his shoulder.
**Sensation:** Intense itching. Heat. The feeling of ants crawling inside his bones.
**Ariel:** "Knit. Repair. Optimize."

When he woke up in the real world at 7:00 AM, the bandages were loose. The swelling was gone. The bone felt tender, but solid.
**Ariel:** "Recovered 95%. I can move."

### School: The Secret Keeper (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Ariel walked into class. He wasn't wearing the sling. He moved stiffly, but he was functioning.
Issei was acting weird. He kept glancing at Rias, then at his hand, then at the window.

**Ariel (Internal):** *He’s a Devil now. Rias saved him. I can see the energy connecting them. A crimson thread.*

### Lunch: The Quartet’s Gap (Event)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

Issei sat with the guys, but he wasn't looking at the girl magazine Matsuda brought. He was staring at the Old School Building.
**Matsuda:** "Issei? Earth to Issei! Did the date fry your brain?"

**Issei:** "Huh? Oh! Yeah! The date! Uh... she moved away! To... England! Long distance!"

**Ariel:** (Eating a protein bar) "England. Tough break."

Ren (Route B) would have been bitter about the lie.
Ariel (Route A) was **Relieved**.
*Ariel:* "He has a cover story. Good. Rias is taking care of him."

**Issei:** "So... Ariel. You okay? You look... better."
**Ariel:** "I drank a lot of milk, Issei. Calcium."

### Afternoon: The Formal Entry (Issei Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom.

Issei went to the clubroom.
**Rias:** "Welcome, Issei. Meet your family."
He met **Akeno**, **Koneko**, and **Kiba**. He learned about the Evil Pieces. He learned he was a Pawn.
**Issei:** "I'll work hard, Buchou! I'll become the Harem King!"
**Koneko:** "Scum."

### Evening: The Map of the Soul (Module 21 Deep Dive)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).
**Time:** 6:00 PM.

While Issei was out struggling with his first contract (summoning a bicycle), Ariel was back in the PTD.
**[Command: Full Body Mapping]**

He stood in the white room. A giant diagram appeared in the air.

* **Meridians:** 12 Major channels.
* **Tsubo (Pressure Points):** 361 points.
* **Dantian (Core):** The battery.

**System:** *"Most martial artists spend decades sensing these points through intuition. PTD will highlight them via Haptic Feedback."*

**The Training:**
The PTD sent a small electrical pulse to Ariel's real body.
*Zzt.* (Left Wrist).
**Ariel:** "Lung Meridian, Point 7."
*Zzt.* (Solar Plexus).
**Ariel:** "Conception Vessel."

He wasn't guessing. He was **Memorizing the Circuitry**.
He spent the evening mapping his entire nervous system.
*Ariel:* "If I know where the energy flows, I can overclock it. I can divert power to my legs for speed, or my skin for armor."

He closed his eyes and pushed energy through the map.
It wasn't a trickle anymore. It was a highway.
**Ariel:** "Issei has the Dragon Engine. I have the Schematic."

---

### 📊 Day 15 Stats:

* **PHY:** 1.9 (Rapid recovery confirmed).
* **MND:** 6.5 (Internal Anatomy mapped).
* **SPR:** 0.6 (Control over Ki flow established).
* **TEC:** 8.0 (Bio-Feedback mastery).
* **Status:** Injury healed. Energy system online.

## Day 16 (Tuesday): The Golden Ball and The Devil’s Dinner

### Morning: The Deduction (Social)

**Time:** 7:30 AM.
**Location:** The Route to School.

Ariel met Issei at the corner. Issei was looking at a pamphlet on "How to Summon Familiars." He hid it quickly.
**Issei:** "Hey, Ariel! Nice weather!"

Ariel looked at Issei.
**[Module 7: Awareness]** + **[Module 5: Deduction]**

* *Observation:* Issei's posture is different. He's not slouching. His energy levels are higher.
* *Observation:* He is hiding occult literature.
* *Observation:* The wound from Sunday is completely gone.

**Ariel:** "Issei. You're terrible at being a spy."
**Issei:** "What? I'm not a spy!"

**Ariel:** "You died on Sunday. Rias Gremory showed up. Now you're reading demon pamphlets and calling her 'Buchou' with a capital B. It doesn't take a genius."
**Issei:** (Sweating) "I... uh... she told me not to tell humans! It's a secret!"

**Ariel:** (Smiling) "It's fine. I won't tell. Just don't get killed again. You're in the game now, Issei. Level up."
**Issei:** "Heh. You really are sharp, Ariel. Yeah. I'm a Devil now. A Pawn."

**Ariel:** "A Pawn? That means you can promote. Aim for Queen, Issei."
*Ariel's Thought:* *Devils. Confirmed. If Issei is a Devil, Rias is the King. The hierarchy is set.*

### Lunch: The Daughter of Satan (PTD Module 21 - Videl Style)

**Time:** 12:30 PM (Free Time).
**Location:** The PTD Interface (Mental Space in Empty Classroom).

**[Command: Load Data Pack - Dragon Ball Z (The Videl Method)]**
**Objective:** **External Projection.**

Ariel stood in a rocky wasteland simulation.
**Instructor:** **Gohan** (Teen).
**Partner:** **Videl**.

**Gohan:** *"Ki is the energy inside you. You have to draw it out. Find the quiet place inside."*

Ariel watched Videl struggle. She had the physical strength, but her channels were blocked. She had to *push* the energy through the blockage in her hands.

**Ariel:** "It's not about clearing the path first. It's about using the pressure of the Ki to *force* the path open. The 'Videl Method' is brute-force unblocking."

**The Drill:**
Ariel held his hands cupped at his waist.
He gathered the heat in his gut.
*Ariel:* "Push it up. Past the diaphragm. Past the shoulder. Into the arm."
He felt the resistance at his wrist (The Blockage).
*Ariel:* "Break it."
He clenched his muscles. He pushed the energy against the skin of his palms.
*Burn.* It felt like holding hot coals.

**Videl (Sim):** *"I feel it...!"*
Ariel felt it too. A tiny sphere of light flickered into existence between his hands.
It wasn't a blast. It was a marble of light.
**Ariel:** "Contact. External projection achieved."

### Afternoon: The Saint (Event)

**Location:** Town Square. 4:00 PM.

Ariel and Issei were walking.
**Issei:** "So, about tonight... Rias wants to have a dinner at my place. To celebrate... me surviving."
**Ariel:** "I'm invited?"
**Issei:** "Yeah! She wants to thank you for the tactical assist."

Suddenly, **Asia Argento** tripped out of an alleyway.
**Asia:** "Ouchie..."

Issei rushed to help her. Ariel hung back, analyzing.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
Unlike Ren (who saw emptiness), Ariel saw **Potential**.
He saw the green aura radiating from her rings.
*Ariel:* "That's high-density healing magic. A Sacred Gear? She's a Healer class. High value."

**Asia:** "I am going to the church on the hill."
**Issei:** "The abandoned one? That's dangerous!"

**Ariel:** (Stepping in) "Issei is right. Tactical assessment: That building is structurally unsound and located in a hostile territory (Fallen Angel turf). You are walking into a kill box."

**Asia:** "But I must go..."
**Ariel:** "Fine. We escort you to the perimeter. But keep your eyes open, Sister. The wolves are out."

They walked her to the gate. Ariel marked the location on his mental map.
*Ariel:* "Raynare is in there. I can feel the static."

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Event)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence. 7:00 PM.

The dinner was lively. **Rias** and **Akeno** were charming Issei's parents.
Ariel sat quietly, observing the social hierarchy.

**Rias:** "Ariel-kun. Issei tells me you figured us out."
**Ariel:** "It wasn't hard. Red light. Wings. Chess pieces. You're Devils."

Rias smiled. "And you are taking it very well."
**Ariel:** "I adapt. Issei is happy. You saved him. That's what matters."

**Akeno:** "Ara ara. You're very calm for a human sitting with monsters."
**Ariel:** "Monsters don't cook curry this good, Akeno-san."

Ariel watched them. He realized they weren't evil. They were a *Clan*.
And Issei was the new recruit.
*Ariel:* "He's safe here. But he's weak. He needs to train."

### Night: The Golden Light (PTD Module 21 Mastery)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment. 10:00 PM.

Ariel returned home. He was buzzing with the energy of the dinner and the success of the afternoon.
He sat on his floor.

**Ariel:** "Gohan showed me the door. Now I walk through."

**[Module 21: Inner Energy]**
He cupped his hands again.
He recalled the sensation from the Videl simulation. The pressure. The breakthrough.
He pushed his Ki.
The blockage in his hands (Minor Chakras) cracked fully open.

*FWOOSH.*

A ball of golden energy, the size of a baseball, materialized in his hands. It lit up the dark room.
It was warm. It hummed.
**Ariel:** "Ki. Real Ki."

He moved his hands apart. The ball dissipated.
He formed it again. Faster.
**Ariel:** "I can create light. Next step: Propulsion. If I can push this out of my feet... I can fly."

**[System Update: Ki Control (Basic) Unlocked. Hands Unblocked.]**

Ariel smiled, the golden light reflecting in his eyes.
**Ariel:** "Videl learned to fly in ten days. I'll do it in three."

---

## Day 17 (Wednesday): The Kidnap and The Radar of Will

### Morning: The Body of Light (PTD Module 20 & 21)

**Time:** 5:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).

Ariel woke up. The "Ki Ball" mastery from yesterday was just the start.
**[Command: Load Data Pack - Internal Reinforcement]**

* **Source:** *Dragon Ball* (Z-Fighters) / *Hunter x Hunter* (Ten/Ren).
* **Goal:** **Module 20 (Iron Body Integration) + Module 21 (Outer Energy).**

**The Simulation:**
Ariel stood in the white void.
**Ariel:** "If I can hold Ki in my hands, I can hold it in my skin."

1. **Hardening (Iron Body + Ki):**
He didn't just tense his muscles; he flooded the muscle fibers with the golden light.
*Impact Test:* A simulated hammer struck his chest.
*Result:* The Ki acted as a buffer. The impact dispersed.
**Ariel:** "Reinforcement. It increases density without adding mass."
2. **Speed (Burst):**
He pushed the energy into his legs.
*Dash.*
He moved faster than his muscles alone could propel him.

**Theory of Outer Energy:**
The PTD displayed a graph.
*Internal Energy:* Your battery.
*Outer Energy:* The atmosphere (Nature Energy).
**Ariel:** "I can feel the hum of the air. I can't absorb it yet (Sage Mode is too advanced), but I can *ride* it."

### Lunch: The Last Meal (Event)

**Location:** The Park Bench (Near School).

Issei skipped class to hang out with Asia. Ariel joined them as security.
They sat on a bench, eating sandwiches.
**Issei:** "Asia-chan, you should try the burger place next time!"
**Asia:** "It sounds wonderful, Issei-san! Ren-san, will you come too?"

Ariel smiled.
**Ariel:** "I'll tag along. Someone has to make sure Issei doesn't order the kiddie meal."

**The Trap:**
A magic circle appeared. **Blue**.
**Raynare** (in Yuuma form) stepped out.
**Raynare:** "Found you, little healer."

**Ariel:** "Contact!"
Ariel moved. He used **[Burst Speed]**.
But **Freed Sellzen** dropped from the trees behind Asia.
**Freed:** "Too slow, sinners!"
He grabbed Asia by the hair.

Issei charged. "**BOOST!**"
Freed kicked Issei. Raynare grabbed Asia.
**Raynare:** "The Twilight Healing is mine."
They vanished.

Issei pounded the ground.
**Issei:** "DAMMIT! AGAIN!"

**Ariel:** (Calmly) "We know where they went. The church. Get to your contract, Issei. Rias needs to trust you. Tonight, we prep. Tomorrow, we raid."

### Afternoon: The Blindfold (PTD Module 22 - Part 1)

**Time:** 4:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).

Issei went to work. Ariel went to war.
**Ariel:** "I saw Freed. But I didn't *sense* him until he dropped. My eyes are too slow."

**[Command: Load Data Pack - One Piece (Haki Training)]**

* **Instructor:** **Silvers Rayleigh**.
* **Scenario:** *Rusukaina Island (The Jungle).*

Rayleigh stood before Ariel. He held a wooden staff.
**Rayleigh:** *"Listen, young man. You call it Ki. You call it Chi. Here, we call it **Haki**. It is all the same. It is Spirit."*

**The Lesson:**
Rayleigh tied a blindfold around Ariel's eyes.
**Rayleigh:** *"Your eyes are a distraction. They only see light. You need to see presence. The world is alive. Every rock, every tree, every enemy... they emit a signal."*

**Drill 1: The Static Map**
Ariel stood in the dark.
**Rayleigh:** *"Visualize the terrain. Not the shapes. The energy."*
Ariel pushed his senses out.
He felt the ground. Not the texture, but the *density*.
He felt the trees. They hummed with slow, deep life.
He felt the rocks. They were silent voids in the hum.

**Ariel:** "It's like... sonar. But with feelings."
**Rayleigh:** "Good. That is the Radar. Navigate."

Ariel ran through the jungle blindfolded. He dodged trees. He jumped over roots.
**Ariel:** "I don't need to see the wall. I can feel its resistance to the air."

### Evening: The Beast and The Intent (PTD Module 22 - Part 2)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.

**Rayleigh:** *"Now, the living things. Everything that moves has an Intention. Before a muscle contracts, the Spirit screams 'Move!' Listen for the scream."*

**Drill 2: The Beasts**
The simulation spawned giant animals. Lions. Elephants. Gorillas.
They surrounded Ariel.
**Ariel:** "They are loud. Their energy is wild."

*A Lion pounced.*
Ariel didn't see it. He felt a spike of **Red Aggression** at 4 o'clock.
**Ariel:** "Right!"
He dodged right. The claw missed.

*An Elephant swung its trunk.*
**Intent:** Heavy. Slow. Crushing.
Ariel ducked.

**The Lesson:**
**Rayleigh:** *"Don't wait for the movement. Wait for the Will. The Will travels faster than the body."*

Ariel spent four hours dodging beasts in the dark. He got hit. He got trampled.
But by the end, he wasn't reacting. He was **Predicting**.
He felt the intent form in the beast's mind, and he moved before they did.

**Ariel:** "I can see them. I can see the red sparks of their anger."

### Night: The Integration (Module 7 & 8)

**Time:** 11:00 PM.

Ariel disconnected. He was mentally exhausted, but his senses were wide open.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He sat in his room. He kept the "Haki Radar" active.
He sensed a cockroach in the kitchen.
He sensed his neighbor watching TV.
He sensed the flow of electricity in the walls.

**Ariel:** "I'm ready. The church is dark. Perfect for a radar."

**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He calmed the sensory overload. He focused on **Issei's** signature—a chaotic, burning red light in the distance.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow, we go in. I'll be the eyes. You be the fist."

### 📊 Day 17 Stats:

* **PHY:** 2.1 (Reinforced by Ki).
* **MND:** 7.0 (Sensory processing optimized).
* **SPR:** 1.5 (**Observation Haki: Basic** unlocked. Can sense Presence and Intent).
* **Status:** Radar online. Prep complete.

### Evening: The Beast and The Intent (PTD Module 22 - Part 2 Extended)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** PTD Interface (Rusukaina Jungle).

The simulation shifted. Ariel wasn't alone with Rayleigh anymore.
A boy with a straw hat and bandages appeared. **Luffy**.
**Rayleigh:** *"Two students. Same lesson. Dodge."*

**1. The Energy Signature (Aura Reading)**
The beasts surrounded them.
**Rayleigh:** *"Look deeper. It isn't just 'Anger.' It is the frequency of their life."*
Ariel focused.

* **The Lion:** Sharp, jagged aura. Fast spikes. Like static electricity.
* **The Gorilla:** Dense, heavy aura. A rolling boulder.
* **The Snake:** Cold, thin aura. Slippery. Hard to pin down.

**Ariel:** "I can classify them. I don't need to see the shape. The signature tells me the species."

**2. The Intent (The Spark)**
Luffy was laughing, dodging effortlessly.
*Luffy:* "Whoa! That one was spicy!"
Ariel watched (with his mind's eye). Luffy moved before the aura even fully flared.
**Rayleigh:** *"He senses the desire. Before the lion decides to bite, it *wants* to bite. That want is a signal."*

Ariel synced his breathing.
*A tiger crouched.*
Ariel felt a **red ping** in the void. *Intent: Kill.*
He side-stepped. The tiger flew past.
**Ariel:** "Got it. The thought precedes the action."

**3. The Five Senses Integration (The Challenge)**
**Rayleigh:** *"Now. Open your eyes."*
Ariel removed the blindfold.
The jungle was bright. Noisy. Chaotic.
**Rayleigh:** *"The eyes lie. The ears get overwhelmed. Do not let the light blind your Haki. Layer the senses."*

**The Drill:**
Ariel had to dodge while:

1. **Seeing:** The swaying trees (Distraction).
2. **Hearing:** The roaring wind (Noise).
3. **Sensing:** The Intent (Truth).

*A Leopard jumped from the shadows.*

* **Eyes:** Saw a blur of spots. (Too slow).
* **Ears:** Heard a rustle. (Too late).
* **Haki:** Felt the killing intent 0.5 seconds ago.

Ariel trusted the **Haki**. He ignored his eyes telling him "It's far away" and ducked. The claws raked the air where his head was.
**Ariel:** "Vision is just confirmation. Haki is the warning."

He fought back-to-back with Luffy for hours.
Luffy used rubber elasticity. Ariel used **CQC** and **Ki Reinforcement**.
Together, they cleared the clearing.

**Luffy:** (Grinning) "You're getting better, Shishishishi!"
**Ariel:** "Trying to keep up with the Pirate King is a workout."

Ariel wiped sweat from his brow.
**Ariel:** "My eyes aren't a liability anymore. They are just another sensor in the array."

---

### 📊 Updated Day 17 Stats

* **Skill Unlocked:** **Integrated Perception.** (Can use Observation Haki with eyes open without sensory overload).
* **Status:** Ready for the chaos of the Church Raid.

## Day 18 (Thursday): The Raid on the Church

### Morning: The Grand Cycle (Meditation)

**Time:** 5:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel sat in the center of his room. He wasn't using the PTD interface. He was integrating the software into his wetware (brain).
**[Module 8: Meditation]**

He closed his eyes and cycled through his "Drivers":

1. **The Mind (Solid Snake/Leon):** *Tactical assessment. Resource management. Fear suppression.*
2. **The Body (Tekken/MGS):** *CQC reflexes. Bone breaking. Disarming.*
3. **The Energy (Gohan):** *Golden Ki coursing through his meridians. Reinforcing skin and bone.*
4. **The Senses (Luffy/Rayleigh):** *Observation Haki. The Radar.*

He breathed in. The air felt heavy with information.
He breathed out. The golden aura flickered briefly around his skin.
**Ariel:** "System Check: Green. I am no longer a civilian."

### Lunch: The Trap (Event)

**Location:** The Cafeteria.

Issei was shaking. He slammed his phone on the table.
**Issei:** "She sent a message."

Ariel looked at the screen. A picture of Asia tied to a cross.
**Text:** *"Come alone, darling. Let's finish our date."*

**Ariel:** "It's a trap."
**Issei:** "I don't care! I'm going!"
**Ariel:** "I know. But we don't walk into traps blindly. We spring them on *our* terms."

**[Haki Scan (Low Level)]**
Ariel focused on the phone. He felt the residual energy on the digital file.
*Ariel:* "Malice. Arrogance. And... impatience."
**Ariel:** "She wants you there at sunset. That gives us 5 hours to prep."

### Afternoon: The Loadout (Preparation)

**Time:** 3:00 PM.
**Location:** Hardware Store / Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel didn't buy weapons this time. He bought **Conduits**.

* **Weighted Gloves:** Leather knuckles filled with lead shot.
* **Steel Baton (Collapsible):** Standard security issue.
* **Smoke Bombs (Homemade):** Sugar and Potassium Nitrate.

**The Enchantment (Module 21):**
He sat with his gear.
He held the steel baton. He poured his **Ki** into it.
*Ariel:* "Steel is too brittle against light magic. I need to coat it."
He wrapped the weapon in a thin film of energy. It wasn't a Noble Phantasm, but it would hold together for a few hits against a Light Spear.

**The Strategy:**
He met with Issei, Kiba, and Koneko (who decided to help against orders).
**Ariel:** "Issei is the bait. Kiba is the vanguard. Koneko is the siegebreaker. I am the Ghost."
**Kiba:** "The Ghost?"
**Ariel:** "I watch your backs. If something invisible attacks, I'll see it."

### Evening: The Raid (The Church)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** The Abandoned Church.

The sky was blood red. The building loomed like a skull.

**1. The Approach (Observation Haki)**
They stood at the gate.
**Issei:** "I'm going to kick the door down!"
**Ariel:** "Wait."
Ariel closed his eyes. **[Module 22: Radar]**.
The world turned into a wireframe grid in his mind.

* *Inside:* Four signals.
* *One Green (Asia).* Weak. Fading.
* *One Violet (Raynare).* High energy.
* *One Chaotic Purple (Freed).* Erratic. Moving on the ceiling.
* *Multiple Grey (Exorcists).* Fodder.

**Ariel:** "Freed is above the door. Ambush position. Kiba, take high guard."

**2. The Breach**
Issei kicked the door. *CRASH.*
**Freed:** "Amen, sinners!"
Freed dropped from the ceiling, light sword slashing.
**Kiba:** "Got him!"
Kiba intercepted. Sparks flew.

**3. The Melee (Ariel vs. Exorcists)**
Lower-level exorcists rushed Issei.
Issei was struggling to summon his gear.
Ariel stepped in.
**[Module 19: Tekken Style - Mishima Karate]**
He didn't use a weapon. He used the **Weighted Gloves** + **Ki Reinforcement**.
*Exorcist swings a sword.*
Ariel sensed the intent. *Duck. Step in.*
**Ariel:** "Wind God Fist!"
He drove an uppercut into the exorcist’s gut. The Ki flared. The exorcist was launched three meters back, unconscious.
**Koneko:** (Watching) "Not bad."

**4. The Dungeon (The Ritual)**
They descended to the basement.
Raynare stood before the altar. Asia was hanging on the cross. The **Twilight Healing** was being extracted—a green light flowing into Raynare.
**Raynare:** "You're too late."

Issei charged. "**BOOST!**"
Raynare laughed. She had the healing factor now.
She threw a volley of Light Spears.

**Ariel:** "Eyes open!"
He activated **Integrated Perception** (Haki + Vision).
He saw the trajectory of every spear before it left her hand.
**Ariel:** "Kiba, 2 o'clock! Koneko, low!"
He directed the team like a traffic controller.

**5. The Confrontation (Round 2)**
Raynare focused on Ariel.
**Raynare:** "The worm survived? And you brought a stick?"
She saw his collapsible baton.

**Ariel:** "It's not just a stick."
He extended it. *Snick.*
He channeled his **Ki**. The baton glowed with a faint golden aura (Reinforcement).
**Ariel:** "It's a conductor."

Raynare swooped down.
**Raynare:** "Die!"
She stabbed with a Light Spear.
Last time, Ariel’s weapon melted.
This time, **Ki met Magic**.
*CLANG.*
The baton held. The energy coating repelled the light.

Ariel didn't recoil. He used **[Module 16: CQC]**.
He deflected the spear to the side, stepped into her guard (The Boss style), and slammed the baton into her ribs.
*CRACK.*
**Raynare:** "Gah! How?!"

**Ariel:** "Upgrade."

**6. The End**
Issei reached Asia. But she was lifeless. The gear was gone.
Issei screamed. The Red Dragon Gauntlet evolved.
He charged Raynare in a berserker rage.

Ariel stood back. His baton was smoking, the metal finally giving way to the heat.
**Ariel:** "My job is done. The tank has aggro."

Rias Gremory arrived to finish the job and resurrect Asia.
Ariel watched from the shadows. He saw Rias claim Asia as a Bishop.
He felt the **King's Aura** from Rias. It was massive.
**Ariel:** (Internal) *That is the power ceiling. I'm barely at the floorboards.*

He sheathed his melted baton.
**Ariel:** "Mission Accomplished. VIP secured."
