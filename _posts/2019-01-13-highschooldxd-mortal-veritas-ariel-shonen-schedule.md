Ariel Shonen are by Fajar Purnama and Gemini Pro AI

## Day 1 (Monday): The Operator and The Heist
### Morning: The Virtual Gym (Module 1-4 & 14)
Time: 5:00 AM.
#### Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
Ariel woke up. He didn't groan about school; he checked his imaginary HUD.
Ariel: "Day 1. Stats are garbage. Let's fix that."
He closed his eyes. [Command: Enter PTD].
The room dissolved into a grey, wireframe grid.
Time Dilation: 1 Hour Real = 2 Hours Sim. (Low Level).
Scenario: Standard Gym.
Ariel spawned weights, pull-up bars, and a treadmill.
[Module 14: Muscle Training]
He didn't just lift; he analyzed.
Ariel: "Pectoral engagement low. Adjust angle."
He did 200 virtual pushups. His real body twitched on the bed, firing the neural pathways. The brain was learning the strain, even if the muscle wasn't tearing yet.
[Module 3: Daily Movement]
He practiced Tactical Walking (Solid Snake style). Rolling the feet. Lowering the silhouette.
Ariel: "If I walk like a civilian, I die like a civilian."
He exited the PTD at 6:30 AM, sweating mentally. He grabbed a protein shake and ran to meet Issei.
The Commute:
Issei was dragging his feet.
Issei: "Monday... why..."
Ariel: "Pick up the pace, Issei! The morning air is full of nitrogen! Good for the lungs! Race you to the gate!"
Issei: "You have too much energy, dude!"
School: The Silent Processor (Module 7 & 8)
#### Location: Class 2-B.
The teacher droned on about history. Issei was asleep.
Ariel sat upright, posture perfect.
[Module 8: Empty Mind]
He visualized a trash can. Every word the teacher said that wasn't on the test went into the bin. Every relevant fact was filed.
Efficiency.
[Module 7: Awareness]
He scanned his own body.
Pulse: 65. Left calf tight. Spine curved 2 degrees.
He micro-adjusted his seating position to optimize blood flow. He was training his nervous system to be hyper-aware of his own biology.
### Lunch: The War Room (Social)
Location: The Cafeteria.
The Perverted Quartet assembled.
Matsuda: "Target acquired. Kendo Club. Changing Room. 3:45 PM."
Ren (Route B) would have sighed and pointed out the flaws.
Ariel (Route A) grinned. He pulled out a napkin and a pen.
Ariel: "Gentlemen, this isn't a peep. This is a Black Ops Extraction of Visual Data."
He drew a diagram.
Ariel: "Matsuda, you're Bravo Team. Create a diversion near the vending machines. Motohama, you're Charlie Team. Watch for the Student Council. Issei, you're Alpha. We take the vents."
Issei: "Vents? Like in the movies?"
Ariel: "Like in Metal Gear. Low noise discipline. Hand signals only. If we get caught, disavow all knowledge."
Issei: "Yes sir! Operator Ariel!"
Ariel didn't care about the girls. He cared about the Mission Success Rate.
### Afternoon: The Heist (Event)
#### Location: Behind the Gymnasium.
The operation commenced.
Ariel moved with [Module 12: Stealth (Basic)]. He moved quietly, placing his feet carefully.
Issei... tried. He stepped on a twig. CRACK.
Ariel: (Whispering) "Contact front!"
A shadow fell over them.
Koneko Toujou stood on the fence.
Koneko: "Scum."
Matsuda and Motohama fled. Issei froze.
Ariel stood up. He didn't feel shame; he felt Tactical Failure.
Ariel: "Ambush. We were flanked."
Koneko jumped down. She threw a punch at Issei.
Issei took it in the gut. "Guh!"
She turned to Ariel.
Ariel: "Physical confrontation inevitable."
He raised his guard. [Module 10: Basic Stance].
He tried to parry.
WHAM.
Koneko’s fist hit his arms. The force was like a hydraulic press. Ariel was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall.
Status: Bruised forearms. Winded.
Koneko: "Don't come back."
Ariel's Analysis:
He slid down the wall. He wasn't crying. He was calculating.
Ariel: "That wasn't muscle. That was... density? Physics doesn't support a girl of her mass generating that force. Supernatural variable confirmed."
### Evening: The Urban Free-Run (Module 13 & 17)
#### Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).
He went home. He was sore, but excited.
Ariel: "I lost because I was stationary. I need verticality."
[Command: Enter PTD]
Scenario: Urban Rooftops (Mirror's Edge).
[Module 13: Open World Movement] + [Module 17: Acrobatics]
Ariel ran through the simulation.
Jump.
He missed the ledge. Fell 20 stories. SPLAT.
[System Error: User Death. Resetting.]
He woke up with a headache.
Ariel: "Again."
Run. Vault. Roll.
He practiced the Parkour Roll to absorb impact.
He practiced the Wall Run to gain height.
He spent 4 hours (Simulated) running away from imaginary agents.
Ariel: "Flow. Don't stop. Obstacles are just paths."
### Night: The Integration (Module 7, 8, 9)
Time: 10:00 PM.
He lay in bed. His real body was rested, but his mind remembered the sensation of falling.
[Module 7: Awareness]
He relaxed his muscles one by one.
Release tension. Reset.
[Module 9: Lucid Dream]
Ariel: "Tonight... I replay the Koneko fight. I want to see if I can dodge that punch if I use the wall."
He fell asleep, optimizing his defeat into a lesson.

 * PHY: 1.1 (Virtual conditioning active).

Ariel sat in class.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

### Lunch: The Trade (Social)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

The Quartet gathered. Ariel participated enthusiastically.

**Matsuda:** "Deal! Ariel, you have good taste."
**Issei:** "You guys are obsessed."
**Ariel:** "It's not obsession, Issei. It's **Asset Collection**."

He treated the magazines like rare loot drops. It kept the "Pervert" cover intact while actually just being a way to bond.

### Afternoon: The Escape (Event)

**Location:** Behind the Gymnasium.

They were in position again. Ariel was leading.
**Ariel:** "Okay. Koneko patrols the perimeter. We have a 30-second window."

Suddenly, **Koneko** dropped from the roof.

Issei froze. "Not again!"

Ariel didn't freeze. He didn't try to talk (like Ren).

**[Module 12: Stealth Escape]**
Ariel dropped a handful of dust (pocket sand) to create a visual distraction.
He vaulted over the fence using **[Module 13: Parkour]**.
He rolled into the bushes and went silent. **[Module 18: Breath Control]**.

Koneko punched Issei. *Whack.*
She looked around for Ariel. She sniffed the air.
**Koneko:** "Gone?"

A horde of delinquents surrounded him. They didn't use karate; they used haymakers, headbutts, and tackles.

* **Move 2:** Another grabbed him. Ariel stomped on his foot and elbowed his face. **(Dirty Fighting)**.
* **Move 3:** Ariel practiced the **"Bully" Takedown**. Tackle the legs, mount, and ground-and-pound.

He used the jungle gym.
*Vault.* He cleared the bars.
*Swing.* He used momentum to launch himself.
*Roll.* He hit the sand and came up running.

**Ariel:** "Agility isn't speed. It's control. If I fall, I turn it into a roll. If I jump, I land running."
He practiced **backflips** not to show off, but to evade a sweeping leg kick.
*Ariel:* "Create distance. Reset the engagement."

### School: The Spark (Module 7, 8, 20-Attempt)

**Location:** Class 2-B. History.

Issei was drooling on his desk.
Ariel sat in **[Module 8: Empty Mind]**.
He was bored with "Human Stats." He wanted the upgrade.

**[Module 20: Inner Energy (Attempt)]**
He focused on his core.
*Ariel:* "Ren (Route B) found the Void. I need to find the **Flow**."
He visualized his blood as energy. He tried to heat it up.

He stabbed the soft spot under the chin (simulated non-lethal, just pressure).

The Quartet gathered.
**Matsuda:** "The pool plan is solid. But we need a lookout."

**Ariel:** (Smiling) "I'll do it. But we need contingencies. If the Student Council patrols, we need an exit route."
He drew a map on a napkin.
**Ariel:** "Motohama, you watch the East Gate. If you see Tsubaki, you cough loudly. That's the signal to scatter."

**Issei:** "You treat peeping like a military operation, dude."
**Ariel:** "Because getting caught is a tactical failure, Issei. We aim for success."

### Afternoon: The Digital Battlefield (Arcade Event)

**Location:** SEGA Arcade. 3:30 PM.

The boys hit the arcade.

He watched Issei's hands.
*Issei twitched.*
Ariel blocked low. Punished.
**Ariel:** "You telegraph your inputs, Issei. You hold your breath before a super."

**Issei:** "Stop reading my mind!"
**Ariel:** "I'm reading your body language. In a real fight, that gets you killed."

*O-Goshi (Hip Throw).*
He used her momentum to slam her into the digital floor.
**Ariel:** "Gravity is the ultimate weapon."
* **Drill 2 (The Disarm):**
She drew a knife. Ariel caught her wrist, twisted the thumb joint, and stripped the weapon.

**Ariel:** "The weapon is now mine."

He practiced until the movements were automatic. He wasn't thinking; his body was reacting to kinetic energy.

### School: The Flyer (Event)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was walking to his desk. A girl in a uniform handed him a flyer.
**Girl:** "Need a wish granted?"
**Issei:** "Huh? Weird."
He stuffed it in his pocket.

Ariel sat in the back.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He felt a *prickle*.

When it was his turn, he sang a perfect, somber ballad (*Baka Mitai*).

*Ariel:* "Smooth is fast."
* **Drill 2 (Trajectory):**
He fired a handgun. He watched the bullet path.
**Ariel:** "A bullet travels in a straight line, affected by gravity and wind. Magic projectiles (Light Spears) likely follow similar physics but with higher velocity."
He practiced **dodging** simulated gunfire.

Ariel woke up in a Soviet jungle. He wasn't playing a game; he *was* Naked Snake.
The air was humid. The mud was wet.

* *Ariel:* "Become the grass. Become the mud."

**2. The End (Patience):**
He fought the legendary sniper, **The End**.
He lay in the mud for 4 simulated hours (2 real hours). He slowed his heart rate to mask his thermal signature.

**2. Gray Fox (The Speed Check):**
He fought the Cyborg Ninja in the lab.

The psychic tried to read his mind.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

### Afternoon: The Old War (MGS4 - Guns of the Patriots)

**Time:** 4:00 PM (Real Time).
**Scenario:** *The War Economy.*

Ariel’s avatar aged. He was **Old Snake**. His back hurt. His stamina bar was short.
**Lesson:** Fighting when the body is broken.

**1. The Microwave Hall (The Willpower Test):**
This was the climax of the training.
Ariel had to walk through a hallway of microwave radiation.
His PTD simulated the pain—the feeling of his skin cooking, his nerves firing, his muscles failing.
He crawled. He dragged himself.
**[Module 22: Will / Intent]**
*Ariel:* "Don't stop. Don't stop. If I stop, everyone dies."

Ariel built a base. He managed resources. He extracted soldiers via Fulton balloon.
**Lesson:** **Logistics.**

He realized he couldn't do everything alone. He needed Rias. He needed the Club.

### Night: The Debriefing (Module 7)

**Time:** 10:00 PM (Real Time).
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel disconnected.
He gasped, sitting up in bed. His real body hadn't moved, but his brain felt like it had lived three lifetimes. He was drenched in sweat from the psychosomatic stress.

**Status Check:**

* **Muscle Memory:** Upgraded. He felt like he knew how to hold a knife in 15 different ways.
* **Mental State:** Hardened. He had "lived" through betrayal, war, and sacrifice.

**Ariel:** "Big Boss was just a man. Solid Snake was just a clone. They killed superweapons with nothing but skills and cigarettes."

He looked at his hands.
**Ariel:** "I am the flesh and blood. And I will take down the supernatural."

He slept, not needing a lucid dream tonight. He had lived enough dreams for one day.

Ariel didn't train physically. His muscles needed to knit after the MGS marathon.
He sat at his desk, surrounded by his "Sacred Texts"—manga volumes, light novels, and downloaded lore.

**1. Dragon Ball (The Ceiling):**
He flipped through the Saiyan Saga.
*Ariel:* "Krillin and Tien. They stood on the same battlefield as Nappa and Vegeta. They died, yes. But they fought. They used **Ki** to bridge the biological gap."
*Takeaway:* "Ki Control" is the prerequisite for relevance. Without energy projection, I am just a target.

**2. One Piece (The Equalizer):**
He watched a clip of **Vergo** vs. Smoker.
*Ariel:* "Armament Haki. It makes the body harder than steel. It allows a human to hit smoke."
*Takeaway:* This is the solution to the **Logia Problem** (Riser's Fire). If I can learn to coat my skin in **Will**, I can punch the Phoenix.

**3. Naruto & Bleach (The Flow):**
He reviewed Chakra control (Tree Climbing) and Reiatsu (Spiritual Pressure).
*Ariel:* "It's all about adhesion and projection. Sticking to walls. Crushing the air with presence."

**4. Wuxia / Murim (The Mechanics):**
He opened a web novel app (*Nano Machine / Return of the Mount Hua Sect*).
He studied the diagrams of **Meridians** and **Dantians**.
*Ariel:* "This is the manual. Dragon Ball tells me *what* to do (Blast). Wuxia tells me *how* (Circulate Qi from the Dantian through the twelve meridians). I need to clear my blockages."

**Conclusion:**
Ariel closed the books.
**Ariel:** "I have the theory. The PTD gives me the practice. Now I need the **Nerves**."

### Midday: The Mansion of Fear (PTD - Resident Evil 1)

**Time:** 12:00 PM.
**Location:** PTD Interface.
**[Command: Load Scenario - Survival Horror]**
**[Module 6: Fear Training] + [Module 15: Knife]**

Ariel stood in the main hall of the **Spencer Mansion**. The air smelled of dust and rot.
**Objective:** Survive with limited resources.

**The Zombie:**
A zombie turned the corner, groaning.
Ariel’s heart rate spiked to 120 BPM. **[Module 6 Alert]**.
**Ariel:** "It's rotting flesh. Biological hazard. Threat level: Low."

He forced his breathing to slow.
He drew his knife.
**[Module 16: CQC]**
The zombie lunged. Ariel stepped side, grabbed the hair, and drove the knife into the brain stem.
*Squelch.*
**Ariel:** "Disgusting. But effective."

He moved through the mansion. Ammo was scarce. He counted every bullet.
*Ariel:* "1... 2... Headshot."
He learned **Trigger Discipline** under stress.

### Afternoon: The Nemesis (PTD - Resident Evil 3)

**Time:** 3:00 PM.
**Scenario:** *Raccoon City Streets.*

**[Module 13: Parkour] + [Module 6: Fear Training]**
Ariel was running. Behind him, a massive bioweapon (**Nemesis**) roared "STARS!" and fired a rocket launcher.

**The Lesson:** **You cannot kill it.**
Ariel realized he couldn't fight Nemesis with a handgun. He had to **Evade**.
*Explosion.*
Ariel rolled, using the blast wave to boost his jump over a barricade.
**Ariel:** "If the enemy is invincible (like Riser), you don't trade blows. You lure them into environmental traps."

He shot a red barrel as Nemesis passed it. *BOOM.*
It slowed the monster down. Ariel escaped.
**Ariel:** "Victory is survival."

### Evening: The Village (PTD - Resident Evil 4)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Scenario:** *The Pueblo.*

**[Module 19: Firearms & Martial Arts Synthesis]**
Ariel stood in the village square. A crowd of Ganados (infected villagers) swarmed him.
**Ariel:** "Crowd control."

He channeled **Leon S. Kennedy**.

* *Shot* to the kneecap (Stun).
* *Sprint* in.
* **Roundhouse Kick** to the head. (Area of Effect knockback).

He practiced switching between **Gun** and **Knife** instantly.

* *Parry* a thrown axe with the knife.
* *Shoot* the thrower.
* *Suplex* the enemy behind him.

**Ariel:** "This is the flow. Gun for range. Body for impact. Never stop moving."

He fought the **Chainsaw Man**.
The sound of the revving motor tested his **Module 6**.
*Ariel:* "Don't panic. Watch the blade."
He baited the swing, stepped inside, and shotgunned the enemy point-blank.

### Night: The Reality Check (Module 7 & 8)

**Time:** 10:00 PM. (Real World).
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

Ariel disconnected. He was mentally drained. He felt like he had been running from monsters for 10 hours.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
His hands were steady. The horror didn't shake him anymore. A zombie was just a target. A Tyrant was just a puzzle.

**Ariel:** "If Raynare shows her true form... I won't freeze. I've seen worse."

He sat on his bed.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**
He flushed the violence from his mind. He visualized the Wuxia meridian chart again.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow is Week 2. The Bridge. I need to be ready to warn Issei."

He slept, his dreams silent and orderly.

## Day 8 (Monday): The Honey Pot and The Weapon Master

### Morning: The Bridge (Event)

**Time:** 7:30 AM.
**Location:** The Pedestrian Bridge.

Ariel and Issei were walking to school. Issei was complaining about math. Ariel was practicing **[Module 7: Rhythmic Breathing]**.

A girl was waiting. **Yuuma Amano** (Raynare).
She stepped forward, blushing.
**Yuuma:** "Um... excuse me. Are you Hyoudou Issei?"

Issei pointed at himself. "Me? Yeah?"

**Yuuma:** "Will you... go out with me?"

Issei froze. His brain short-circuited. "Y-YES! I WOULD LOVE TO!"

**Ariel’s Internal Monologue (No Plot Knowledge):**
*Analysis:*

1. *Subject:* Female, attractive, approx. 16 years old.
2. *Target:* Issei, unpopular, known pervert.
3. *Probability:* 0.01%.
*Conclusion:* **Honey Pot.** This is a trap. She is either selling something, recruiting for a cult, or this is a bullying prank.

Ariel stepped in. He didn't use "Killing Intent" (like Ren). He used **Social Engineering**.
**Ariel:** "Hi. I'm his manager. Before he signs anything, are you selling Amway? Or is this for a YouTube prank channel? I need to see the camera crew."

**Yuuma:** (Blinking, confused) "No! I just... saw him around school! I think he's... interesting!"

**Ariel:** "Interesting. Okay. Just so you know, he has no money. If you're kidnapping him for ransom, his parents are middle class."

**Issei:** "Ariel! Stop ruining my life! She likes me!"

Issei shoved Ariel aside, heart-eyes fully activated. Ariel sighed.
**Ariel:** "Alright. But keep your phone on. And send me your GPS location."

### School: The Investigation (Social)

**Location:** The Cafeteria.

Issei was bragging to Matsuda and Motohama.
**Issei:** "She held my hand! It was soft!"
**Matsuda:** "Lies! Deception! You paid her!"

Ariel sat with his bento. He wasn't celebrating. He was thinking.
**[Module 5: Image Training / Deduction]**
*Ariel:* "Her body language was rehearsed. She tilted her head at the exact angle to look cute. She leaned in to invade his space. It’s classic manipulation."

He decided to prep for a **Rescue Mission**.
**Ariel:** "If she leads him to an alleyway to mug him, I need to be ready to jump in."

### Afternoon: The Departure (Event)

**Location:** School Gates.

Issei ran off early.
**Issei:** "I gotta pick an outfit! See ya, Ariel! Don't wait up!"

Ariel watched him go.
**Ariel:** "Don't die of embarrassment, Issei."

Ariel walked home alone. The unease in his gut wasn't "Supernatural Sense" yet. It was just the instinct of a guy who played too many spy games.
**Ariel:** "If Issei gets jumped, I'll need something better than my fists."

**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**

He thought about Issei and Yuuma.
**Ariel:** "Sunday. The date is Sunday. I have 6 days to prepare for a mugging."

**Ariel:** "If they grab him after school, they'll drag him here. Or here."

### School: The Daydreamer (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was useless. He spent the entire day drawing hearts in his notebook.

**Class:** (Laughter).

Ariel sat in the back.

**Ariel:** "Issei. Where is the date happening?"
**Issei:** "The fountain park! Sunday at sunset! It's romantic!"

He planned a recon mission for later in the week.

He grabbed a trash can lid.
*Bash.*
He used it as a shield and a frisbee.

He lay in bed.

He practiced **[Module 22: Will / Intent]**.

**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He cataloged the styles.

* **Mishima:** Power.

* **King:** Control.
* **Eddy:** Flow.

**Ariel:** "I am not a master of one. I am a jack of all trades. And that makes me unpredictable."

**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He settled his mind. Tomorrow was Sunday. The Date.

## Day 14 (Sunday): The Soldier, The Angel, and The Ceiling

### Morning: The Inventory (Module 1, 8, 11)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel sat in the center of his room. His gear was laid out on the floor like a ritual.
**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He breathed slowly. He visualized the "Flow" of combat he learned from the Tekken masters.
*Ariel:* "Mishima power. Kazama defense. Dragunov silence."

**[Module 11: Equipment Check]**
He dressed in tactical civilian gear: dark cargo pants, running shoes, a hoodie reinforced with duct tape on the forearms (poor man’s armor).
He loaded his pockets:

1. **Tactical Flashlight (Strobe).**
2. **Pepper Spray.**
3. **Pocket Sand (Ash/Flour mix).**
4. **Steel Pipe (Concealed in sleeve).**

**Ariel:** "I'm treating this as a Hostage Extraction. Target: Issei Hyoudou. Threat Level: High."

### Midday: The Shadow Detail (Module 12 & 17)

**Location:** The Shopping District.

Ariel tailed the couple.
Issei was laughing, buying crepes. Yuuma was smiling.
**[Module 17: Ninja Awareness]**
Ariel watched Yuuma’s reflection in a shop window.
*Observation:* She checked the sun’s position. She wasn't looking at Issei; she was looking at the clock.
*Ariel:* "She's on a schedule. The hit happens at sunset."

He moved to the park early. He scouted the terrain. He loosened a few cobblestones near the fountain to create tripping hazards. He placed a backup pipe behind the vending machine.
*Ariel:* "Battlefield prep complete."

### Late Afternoon: The Incident (Event)

**Location:** The Park Fountain. Sunset.

Ariel hid behind the vending machine. He popped two **Caffeine Pills** to sharpen his reaction time.
Yuuma led Issei to the fountain.
**Yuuma:** "Issei-kun... would you die for me?"

**Ariel:** "Here we go."

The black wings sprouted. The clothes dissolved into bondage gear. The Light Spear materialized.
Issei froze.

**Ariel's Reaction:**
He didn't freeze. He had played *Resident Evil*. He had fought *Metal Gear*. Monsters were just targets.
**Ariel:** "Contact Front!"

### The Confrontation: Man vs. Myth

**1. The Flashbang Entry**
Raynare raised the spear.
Ariel rolled out from cover. He didn't scream. He threw the **Flashlight** (Strobe Mode ON) right at her face.
*FLASH.*
Raynare flinched, blinded for a second. "Gah! My eyes!"

**2. The Extraction**
Ariel sprinted. **[Module 13: Parkour Dash]**.
He tackled Issei.
**Ariel:** "Move, idiot!"
He shoved Issei behind the fountain wall.

**3. The Engagement (CQC vs. Magic)**
Raynare recovered. "A worm?"
She swooped down, claws extended.
Ariel stood his ground. He drew the **Steel Pipe**.
**[Module 19: Weapons Master - Kendo/Escrima]**

Raynare slashed.
Ariel didn't block; he **Parried**. He struck her wrist with the pipe to deflect the claw.
*CLANG.*
He spun and swung the pipe at her ribs.
*THWACK.*
It connected.
**Raynare:** "Ow! You little..."

She was surprised. He was fast. He was skilled. He fought like a veteran soldier.
But then she stopped playing.

**Raynare:** "Enough."
She flew up, ten meters into the air. Out of reach.
**Ariel:** "Range advantage. Bad."

She summoned a massive **Light Spear**.
**Raynare:** "Parry this."

She threw it.
It wasn't aimed at Ariel. It was aimed at Issei, who was cowering behind the fountain.
Ariel had to intercept.

**4. The Failure (Physics vs. Magic)**
Ariel jumped in front of Issei.
He raised the steel pipe. He braced his body.
**[Module 20 Attempt: Iron Body]**
He tried to channel Ki. He tried to harden his muscles like Garp.
But he hadn't unlocked the PTD's supernatural modules yet. He was just a human bracing against a missile.

*CRASH.*

The Light Spear hit the pipe.
The pipe melted instantly.
The spear continued. It slammed into Ariel’s left shoulder.
*CRUNCH.*
The force shattered his clavicle and humerus. He was blown backward, smashing into Issei.
The spear passed through Ariel's shoulder and pierced Issei’s stomach.

They were pinned together to the concrete.
**Ariel:** "GAAAH!"
**Issei:** (Coughing blood) "Ren... Ariel...?"

### The Aftermath: The Liability

Raynare laughed. "Two birds, one stone."
She flew off, satisfied that the sacred gear possessor was dead.

Ariel was conscious, fighting the shock. He tried to pull the spear out, but his arm was useless.
Then, the Crimson Circle appeared.
**Rias Gremory** arrived.

She looked at the scene.
Issei: Dead.
Ariel: Bleeding out, holding a melted pipe.

She healed them. She resurrected Issei.
Then she stood over Ariel. She looked at his tactical gear. She looked at the traps he set.
**Rias:** "You prepared. You fought."

**Ariel:** (Gritting teeth) "I lost."

**Rias:** "Of course you lost. You are a human fighting a Fallen Angel with a metal stick."
She sighed. It was a sigh of pity.
**Rias:** "You are brave, Ariel. But you are a **Liability**. If you keep trying to fight our wars, you will just be another body I have to bury."

She placed a hand on his forehead.
**Rias:** "I should erase this. For your sake. Go back to being a student. Leave the monsters to us."

**Ariel:** (Slapping her hand away with his good arm) "No."
**Rias:** "Excuse me?"
**Ariel:** "Don't touch my mind. I lost because my hardware was weak. Not my software."

He stood up, swaying.
**Ariel:** "I'm not a liability, Rias. I'm... under-leveled."

Rias looked at him. She saw the fire in his eyes. It wasn't the "Darkness" of Ren. It was the **Stubbornness of a Gamer** who just died to a boss and wants a rematch immediately.
**Rias:** "Fine. Keep your memories. But stay out of the way. Next time, I might not be here to heal you."

She teleported away with Issei.

### Night: The Unlock (The Catalyst)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.
**Time:** 11:00 PM.

Ariel sat on his bed. His arm was healed (magic), but the phantom pain remained.
He looked at the melted steel pipe on his floor.

**Ariel:** "Tactics worked. CQC worked. But she flew. And her weapon melted mine."
He clenched his fist.
**Ariel:** "I hit the Human Ceiling. Solid Snake can't beat Goku. I need an upgrade."

He lay down. He jacked into the **PTD**.
The interface was red. **[System Alert: High Trauma Detected. Adrenaline Levels Critical.]**
**[User Request: Unlock Level 2 Restrictions.]**

Ariel’s mind screamed at the system.
**Ariel:** "I don't want to be a Soldier anymore. I want to be a **Super Soldier**. Give me the Fiction."

**[System Update:]**

* **Time Dilation Increased:** 1 Hour = 1 Day.
* **Library Expansion:** **Unlocked.** (Dragon Ball / One Piece / Wuxia).
* **Objective:** **Break the Human Limit.**

Ariel grinned in the dark.
**Ariel:** "Time to grind."

---

### 📊 Day 14 Stats:

* **PHY:** 1.8 (Broken/Healed).
* **MND:** 6.0 (Combat Data Analyzed: Magic > Steel).
* **TEC:** 7.5 (CQC effective against surprise, failed against power).
* **Status:** **PTD Level 2 Unlocked.** The Mortal Variable enters the supernatural tier.

## Day 14 (Sunday): The Soldier, The Angel, and The Ceiling (Extended Climax)

### Late Afternoon: The Incident (Event)

**Location:** The Park Fountain. Sunset.
**Status:** Ambush Ready.

Ariel hid behind the vending machine. He popped two **Caffeine Pills**. His heart rate climbed to 120 BPM—the optimal zone for combat reflex.
He watched Yuuma transform. The black wings. The bondage gear. The violet light.

**Ariel's Internal Monologue:**
*Target confirmed: Hostile Supernatural Entity.*
*flight capabilities: Confirmed.*
*Energy projection: Confirmed.*
*Survival Probability: < 5%.*
*Mission Objective: Extract the VIP (Issei).*

**Ariel:** "Execute."

### Phase 1: The Breach (Tactical Surprise)

Raynare raised the spear to execute Issei. Issei was frozen in terror.
Ariel didn't run out screaming. He rolled a **Flashbang** (Magnesium Flare taped to a strobe light) onto the pavement between them.

*FLASH.*
A blinding white pulse washed out the sunset.
**Raynare:** "Gah! My eyes!"
She flinched, covering her face with one wing. The Light Spear dissipated as her concentration broke.

**Ariel:** "Move!"
He exploded from cover using **[Module 13: Parkour Sprint]**. He didn't run to fight; he ran to displace.
He tackled Issei with a rugby-style shoulder check, driving him five meters away behind the concrete rim of the fountain.

**Issei:** "Ariel?! What are you—"
**Ariel:** "Stay down. Don't peek."

Ariel vaulted over the fountain wall, putting himself in the open. He drew the **Steel Pipe** from his sleeve and the **Utility Knife** from his belt.
He banged the pipe against the fountain.
*CLANG.*

**Ariel:** "Over here, pigeon."

### Phase 2: The Engagement (CQC vs. Claws)

Raynare lowered her wing. Her eyes were red with irritation.
**Raynare:** "A worm? You interrupted my date."

She swooped down. She didn't use a spear; she used her claws, intending to eviscerate him.
**Speed:** Sub-sonic, but faster than an Olympic sprinter.

**Ariel's Reaction (MND 6.0 - Tactical Processing):**
*She's fast. But she flies in a straight line.*
**[Module 19: Weapons Master - Escrima]**

Ariel waited until she was within 2 meters.
*Step left. Pivot.*
He dodged the claw by inches. The wind pressure cut his cheek.
As she passed, he swung the steel pipe two-handed, aiming for the back of her head.

*CRACK.*

The pipe connected. It felt like hitting a truck tire. Raynare’s head snapped forward, and she crashed into the dirt, tumbling.
**Ariel:** "She has mass. Physics still applies."

He didn't wait. He switched to **[Module 16: CQC]**.
He pinned her wing with his knee. He drove the utility knife toward the unarmored section of her shoulder.
*STAB.*
The blade pierced skin. Purple blood welled up.

**Raynare:** "YOU DARE?!"
She roared. She flared her magical aura. A shockwave of violet energy blasted Ariel off her.
He tucked and rolled, landing on his feet, skidding to a halt.

**Ariel:** "Contact made. Enemy bleeds."

### Phase 3: The Escalation (Magic vs. Tools)

Raynare stood up. She pulled the knife out of her shoulder and crushed it. She wasn't playing anymore.
**Raynare:** "I'm going to peel you."

She flew up, hovering 10 meters in the air.
**Ariel:** "Aerial superiority. Bad."

She summoned three **Light Spears**. She threw them in a spread pattern.
*Zip. Zip. Zip.*

**Ariel:** "Trajectory analysis."
He didn't run away; he ran *forward*, under the arc of the spears.
*Explosion. Explosion. Explosion.*
The spears decimated the ground behind him.

Ariel reached into his pouch. **Pocket Sand (Pepper Mix)**.
He waited for her to dive.
She came down, aiming to grab him.
Ariel threw the powder into the air, creating a choking cloud.
**Raynare:** "Dust? Pathetic!"
She flapped her wings, blowing the cloud away instantly.

**Ariel:** "Damn. Wind mechanics."

She grabbed him by the throat. She lifted him into the air.
**Raynare:** "Caught you."
She squeezed. Ariel’s vision spotted.

**Ariel:** "Not... yet."
He pulled the **Stun Gun / Taser** (bought at the hardware store) from his back pocket. He jammed it into her armpit (unarmored).
*ZAP.*
50,000 volts. It wasn't enough to kill her, but it seized her muscles.
Her grip loosened. Ariel dropped.

### Phase 4: The Sacrifice (The Checkmate)

Ariel landed, gasping. His throat was bruised.
Raynare shook off the paralysis. She was furious now. Her aura was turning the air heavy.

**Raynare:** "I'm done with toys."

She summoned a **Great Light Spear**—massive, glowing, and humming with enough energy to level a building.
She looked at Ariel. Then she looked at the fountain. At Issei.

**Raynare:** "You move well, human. But can you move him?"

She aimed the spear at Issei.
**Ariel:** "Coward!"
**Raynare:** "Winner."

She threw it.

**Ariel's Calculation:**
*Distance to Issei: 5 meters.*
*Spear Speed: High.*
*Issei's Status: Frozen.*
*Option A: Dodge. (Issei dies).*
*Option B: Intercept. (High probability of death).*

Ariel didn't think. He acted. **[Module 13: Burst Speed]**.
He burned every ounce of glycogen in his legs. He launched himself into the path of the projectile.

**Ariel:** "IRON BODY!"
He crossed his arms. He tensed every muscle fiber. He tried to replicate the density of the Tekken masters he studied in the PTD.
*Please, hold.*

*CRASH.*

The Light Spear hit his forearms.
**Reality Check:** Steel melts at 1500°C. Light energy is hotter.
Ariel’s sleeves vaporized. His skin blackened instantly. The force shattered his radius and ulna in both arms.
The spear didn't stop. It plowed through his guard, smashing into his left shoulder, shattering the clavicle.

The momentum carried him backward. He slammed into Issei.
The tip of the spear, dampened by Ariel’s body, pierced through Ariel's back and stabbed into Issei’s stomach.

*THUD.*
They were pinned together to the concrete fountain rim.

**Ariel:** (Coughing blood) "Ghh... blocked... mostly..."
**Issei:** "Ariel...?"

### The Aftermath: The Limit

Raynare laughed, floating above them.
**Raynare:** "A human shield. How noble. How useless."

Ariel tried to lift his arms. They were broken. He tried to stand. His legs were numb from shock.
He looked at Raynare. He wasn't afraid. He was **Frustrated**.

**Ariel's Final Thought:**
*My tactics were perfect. My timing was perfect. My will was perfect.*
*But my body... my body was just meat.*
*Physics lost to Magic.*

The crimson circle appeared. Rias Gremory stepped out.
The cavalry arrived.

---

**Narrative Impact:**
This version emphasizes that Ariel **out-skilled** Raynare for most of the fight. He humiliated her with tactics. He only lost because of the raw stat check (Magic Power vs. Human Durability) at the very end.

This validates his need for the **PTD Upgrade**. He doesn't need to learn *how* to fight; he needs a body that can survive the fight.

## Day 15 (Monday): The Naked King and The Bio-Electric Architect

### Morning: The Dragon’s Surprise (Issei)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence.
**Time:** 6:30 AM.

Issei woke up. He felt something soft and warm pressing against his chest.
He opened his eyes. Crimson hair. Smooth skin.
**Rias Gremory** was sleeping beside him. Naked.

**Issei:** "GYAAAAAH!"

He scrambled backward, falling out of bed with a thud.
**Rias:** (Yawning, stretching elegantly) "Good morning, Issei. A Devil needs to be close to their master to recharge. It’s... efficient."

**Issei:** (Blushing furiously) "Efficient?! It's naked! Wait... yesterday... the park... Raynare..."

**Rias:** "You died. I reincarnated you. You are my Pawn now. Welcome to the Gremory Peerage."

Issei looked at his hand. He felt the pulse of the Dragon.
**Issei:** "I'm... a Devil? And I get to serve you?"
**Rias:** "Yes. Now get dressed. We have school."

### Morning: The System Update (Ariel)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
**Time:** 5:00 AM (Subjective Time Dilation Active).

Ariel woke up in the digital void. His real body was lying in bed, right arm in a sling, left shoulder heavily bandaged from the Light Spear impact.
**[System Alert: PTD Level 2 Unlocked.]**
**[New Module Available: Module 21 (Internal Energy Theory).]**

Ariel opened the file. It wasn't a mystical scroll; it was a biological schematic.
**Ariel:** "Okay, System. How do I fix a shattered clavicle without waiting six weeks?"

**System Voice:** *"Analysis: Life Force (Ki/Qi) is bio-electric energy generated by cellular respiration and mitochondrial activity. Most humans waste 90% of it as heat. Guidance: Redirect waste energy to trauma site."*

A wireframe model of Ariel’s body appeared. It showed the energy leaking off him like steam.
**Ariel:** "It's not magic. It's plumbing."

He focused. The PTD highlighted the exact nerve clusters to stimulate.
*Step 1: Breath Control (Oxygen intake).*
*Step 2: Visualization (Guidance).*
*Step 3: Seal the leak.*

Ariel sat in the void for what felt like hours. He forced the "Steam" of his energy to condense into "Water" and flow toward his shoulder.
**Sensation:** Intense itching. Heat. The feeling of ants crawling inside his bones.
**Ariel:** "Knit. Repair. Optimize."

When he woke up in the real world at 7:00 AM, the bandages were loose. The swelling was gone. The bone felt tender, but solid.
**Ariel:** "Recovered 95%. I can move."

### School: The Secret Keeper (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Ariel walked into class. He wasn't wearing the sling. He moved stiffly, but he was functioning.
Issei was acting weird. He kept glancing at Rias, then at his hand, then at the window.

**Ariel (Internal):** *He’s a Devil now. Rias saved him. I can see the energy connecting them. A crimson thread.*

### Lunch: The Quartet’s Gap (Event)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

Issei sat with the guys, but he wasn't looking at the girl magazine Matsuda brought. He was staring at the Old School Building.
**Matsuda:** "Issei? Earth to Issei! Did the date fry your brain?"

**Issei:** "Huh? Oh! Yeah! The date! Uh... she moved away! To... England! Long distance!"

**Ariel:** (Eating a protein bar) "England. Tough break."

Ren (Route B) would have been bitter about the lie.
Ariel (Route A) was **Relieved**.
*Ariel:* "He has a cover story. Good. Rias is taking care of him."

**Issei:** "So... Ariel. You okay? You look... better."
**Ariel:** "I drank a lot of milk, Issei. Calcium."

### Afternoon: The Formal Entry (Issei Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom.

Issei went to the clubroom.
**Rias:** "Welcome, Issei. Meet your family."
He met **Akeno**, **Koneko**, and **Kiba**. He learned about the Evil Pieces. He learned he was a Pawn.
**Issei:** "I'll work hard, Buchou! I'll become the Harem King!"
**Koneko:** "Scum."

### Evening: The Map of the Soul (Module 21 Deep Dive)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).
**Time:** 6:00 PM.

While Issei was out struggling with his first contract (summoning a bicycle), Ariel was back in the PTD.
**[Command: Full Body Mapping]**

He stood in the white room. A giant diagram appeared in the air.

* **Meridians:** 12 Major channels.
* **Tsubo (Pressure Points):** 361 points.
* **Dantian (Core):** The battery.

**System:** *"Most martial artists spend decades sensing these points through intuition. PTD will highlight them via Haptic Feedback."*

**The Training:**
The PTD sent a small electrical pulse to Ariel's real body.
*Zzt.* (Left Wrist).
**Ariel:** "Lung Meridian, Point 7."
*Zzt.* (Solar Plexus).
**Ariel:** "Conception Vessel."

He wasn't guessing. He was **Memorizing the Circuitry**.
He spent the evening mapping his entire nervous system.
*Ariel:* "If I know where the energy flows, I can overclock it. I can divert power to my legs for speed, or my skin for armor."

He closed his eyes and pushed energy through the map.
It wasn't a trickle anymore. It was a highway.
**Ariel:** "Issei has the Dragon Engine. I have the Schematic."

---

### 📊 Day 15 Stats:

* **PHY:** 1.9 (Rapid recovery confirmed).
* **MND:** 6.5 (Internal Anatomy mapped).
* **SPR:** 0.6 (Control over Ki flow established).
* **TEC:** 8.0 (Bio-Feedback mastery).
* **Status:** Injury healed. Energy system online.

## Day 16 (Tuesday): The Golden Ball and The Devil’s Dinner

### Morning: The Deduction (Social)

**Time:** 7:30 AM.
**Location:** The Route to School.

Ariel met Issei at the corner. Issei was looking at a pamphlet on "How to Summon Familiars." He hid it quickly.
**Issei:** "Hey, Ariel! Nice weather!"

Ariel looked at Issei.
**[Module 7: Awareness]** + **[Module 5: Deduction]**

* *Observation:* Issei's posture is different. He's not slouching. His energy levels are higher.
* *Observation:* He is hiding occult literature.
* *Observation:* The wound from Sunday is completely gone.

**Ariel:** "Issei. You're terrible at being a spy."
**Issei:** "What? I'm not a spy!"

**Ariel:** "You died on Sunday. Rias Gremory showed up. Now you're reading demon pamphlets and calling her 'Buchou' with a capital B. It doesn't take a genius."
**Issei:** (Sweating) "I... uh... she told me not to tell humans! It's a secret!"

**Ariel:** (Smiling) "It's fine. I won't tell. Just don't get killed again. You're in the game now, Issei. Level up."
**Issei:** "Heh. You really are sharp, Ariel. Yeah. I'm a Devil now. A Pawn."

**Ariel:** "A Pawn? That means you can promote. Aim for Queen, Issei."
*Ariel's Thought:* *Devils. Confirmed. If Issei is a Devil, Rias is the King. The hierarchy is set.*

### Lunch: The Daughter of Satan (PTD Module 21 - Videl Style)

**Time:** 12:30 PM (Free Time).
**Location:** The PTD Interface (Mental Space in Empty Classroom).

**[Command: Load Data Pack - Dragon Ball Z (The Videl Method)]**
**Objective:** **External Projection.**

Ariel stood in a rocky wasteland simulation.
**Instructor:** **Gohan** (Teen).
**Partner:** **Videl**.

**Gohan:** *"Ki is the energy inside you. You have to draw it out. Find the quiet place inside."*

Ariel watched Videl struggle. She had the physical strength, but her channels were blocked. She had to *push* the energy through the blockage in her hands.

**Ariel:** "It's not about clearing the path first. It's about using the pressure of the Ki to *force* the path open. The 'Videl Method' is brute-force unblocking."

**The Drill:**
Ariel held his hands cupped at his waist.
He gathered the heat in his gut.
*Ariel:* "Push it up. Past the diaphragm. Past the shoulder. Into the arm."
He felt the resistance at his wrist (The Blockage).
*Ariel:* "Break it."
He clenched his muscles. He pushed the energy against the skin of his palms.
*Burn.* It felt like holding hot coals.

**Videl (Sim):** *"I feel it...!"*
Ariel felt it too. A tiny sphere of light flickered into existence between his hands.
It wasn't a blast. It was a marble of light.
**Ariel:** "Contact. External projection achieved."

### Afternoon: The Saint (Event)

**Location:** Town Square. 4:00 PM.

Ariel and Issei were walking.
**Issei:** "So, about tonight... Rias wants to have a dinner at my place. To celebrate... me surviving."
**Ariel:** "I'm invited?"
**Issei:** "Yeah! She wants to thank you for the tactical assist."

Suddenly, **Asia Argento** tripped out of an alleyway.
**Asia:** "Ouchie..."

Issei rushed to help her. Ariel hung back, analyzing.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
Unlike Ren (who saw emptiness), Ariel saw **Potential**.
He saw the green aura radiating from her rings.
*Ariel:* "That's high-density healing magic. A Sacred Gear? She's a Healer class. High value."

**Asia:** "I am going to the church on the hill."
**Issei:** "The abandoned one? That's dangerous!"

**Ariel:** (Stepping in) "Issei is right. Tactical assessment: That building is structurally unsound and located in a hostile territory (Fallen Angel turf). You are walking into a kill box."

**Asia:** "But I must go..."
**Ariel:** "Fine. We escort you to the perimeter. But keep your eyes open, Sister. The wolves are out."

They walked her to the gate. Ariel marked the location on his mental map.
*Ariel:* "Raynare is in there. I can feel the static."

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Event)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence. 7:00 PM.

The dinner was lively. **Rias** and **Akeno** were charming Issei's parents.
Ariel sat quietly, observing the social hierarchy.

**Rias:** "Ariel-kun. Issei tells me you figured us out."
**Ariel:** "It wasn't hard. Red light. Wings. Chess pieces. You're Devils."

Rias smiled. "And you are taking it very well."
**Ariel:** "I adapt. Issei is happy. You saved him. That's what matters."

**Akeno:** "Ara ara. You're very calm for a human sitting with monsters."
**Ariel:** "Monsters don't cook curry this good, Akeno-san."

Ariel watched them. He realized they weren't evil. They were a *Clan*.
And Issei was the new recruit.
*Ariel:* "He's safe here. But he's weak. He needs to train."

### Night: The Golden Light (PTD Module 21 Mastery)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment. 10:00 PM.

Ariel returned home. He was buzzing with the energy of the dinner and the success of the afternoon.
He sat on his floor.

**Ariel:** "Gohan showed me the door. Now I walk through."

**[Module 21: Inner Energy]**
He cupped his hands again.
He recalled the sensation from the Videl simulation. The pressure. The breakthrough.
He pushed his Ki.
The blockage in his hands (Minor Chakras) cracked fully open.

*FWOOSH.*

A ball of golden energy, the size of a baseball, materialized in his hands. It lit up the dark room.
It was warm. It hummed.
**Ariel:** "Ki. Real Ki."

He moved his hands apart. The ball dissipated.
He formed it again. Faster.
**Ariel:** "I can create light. Next step: Propulsion. If I can push this out of my feet... I can fly."

**[System Update: Ki Control (Basic) Unlocked. Hands Unblocked.]**

Ariel smiled, the golden light reflecting in his eyes.
**Ariel:** "Videl learned to fly in ten days. I'll do it in three."

---

## Day 17 (Wednesday): The Kidnap and The Radar of Will

### Morning: The Body of Light (PTD Module 20 & 21)

**Time:** 5:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).

Ariel woke up. The "Ki Ball" mastery from yesterday was just the start.
**[Command: Load Data Pack - Internal Reinforcement]**

* **Source:** *Dragon Ball* (Z-Fighters) / *Hunter x Hunter* (Ten/Ren).
* **Goal:** **Module 20 (Iron Body Integration) + Module 21 (Outer Energy).**

**The Simulation:**
Ariel stood in the white void.
**Ariel:** "If I can hold Ki in my hands, I can hold it in my skin."

1. **Hardening (Iron Body + Ki):**
He didn't just tense his muscles; he flooded the muscle fibers with the golden light.
*Impact Test:* A simulated hammer struck his chest.
*Result:* The Ki acted as a buffer. The impact dispersed.
**Ariel:** "Reinforcement. It increases density without adding mass."
2. **Speed (Burst):**
He pushed the energy into his legs.
*Dash.*
He moved faster than his muscles alone could propel him.

**Theory of Outer Energy:**
The PTD displayed a graph.
*Internal Energy:* Your battery.
*Outer Energy:* The atmosphere (Nature Energy).
**Ariel:** "I can feel the hum of the air. I can't absorb it yet (Sage Mode is too advanced), but I can *ride* it."

### Lunch: The Last Meal (Event)

**Location:** The Park Bench (Near School).

Issei skipped class to hang out with Asia. Ariel joined them as security.
They sat on a bench, eating sandwiches.
**Issei:** "Asia-chan, you should try the burger place next time!"
**Asia:** "It sounds wonderful, Issei-san! Ren-san, will you come too?"

Ariel smiled.
**Ariel:** "I'll tag along. Someone has to make sure Issei doesn't order the kiddie meal."

**The Trap:**
A magic circle appeared. **Blue**.
**Raynare** (in Yuuma form) stepped out.
**Raynare:** "Found you, little healer."

**Ariel:** "Contact!"
Ariel moved. He used **[Burst Speed]**.
But **Freed Sellzen** dropped from the trees behind Asia.
**Freed:** "Too slow, sinners!"
He grabbed Asia by the hair.

Issei charged. "**BOOST!**"
Freed kicked Issei. Raynare grabbed Asia.
**Raynare:** "The Twilight Healing is mine."
They vanished.

Issei pounded the ground.
**Issei:** "DAMMIT! AGAIN!"

**Ariel:** (Calmly) "We know where they went. The church. Get to your contract, Issei. Rias needs to trust you. Tonight, we prep. Tomorrow, we raid."

### Afternoon: The Blindfold (PTD Module 22 - Part 1)

**Time:** 4:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).

Issei went to work. Ariel went to war.
**Ariel:** "I saw Freed. But I didn't *sense* him until he dropped. My eyes are too slow."

**[Command: Load Data Pack - One Piece (Haki Training)]**

* **Instructor:** **Silvers Rayleigh**.
* **Scenario:** *Rusukaina Island (The Jungle).*

Rayleigh stood before Ariel. He held a wooden staff.
**Rayleigh:** *"Listen, young man. You call it Ki. You call it Chi. Here, we call it **Haki**. It is all the same. It is Spirit."*

**The Lesson:**
Rayleigh tied a blindfold around Ariel's eyes.
**Rayleigh:** *"Your eyes are a distraction. They only see light. You need to see presence. The world is alive. Every rock, every tree, every enemy... they emit a signal."*

**Drill 1: The Static Map**
Ariel stood in the dark.
**Rayleigh:** *"Visualize the terrain. Not the shapes. The energy."*
Ariel pushed his senses out.
He felt the ground. Not the texture, but the *density*.
He felt the trees. They hummed with slow, deep life.
He felt the rocks. They were silent voids in the hum.

**Ariel:** "It's like... sonar. But with feelings."
**Rayleigh:** "Good. That is the Radar. Navigate."

Ariel ran through the jungle blindfolded. He dodged trees. He jumped over roots.
**Ariel:** "I don't need to see the wall. I can feel its resistance to the air."

### Evening: The Beast and The Intent (PTD Module 22 - Part 2)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.

**Rayleigh:** *"Now, the living things. Everything that moves has an Intention. Before a muscle contracts, the Spirit screams 'Move!' Listen for the scream."*

**Drill 2: The Beasts**
The simulation spawned giant animals. Lions. Elephants. Gorillas.
They surrounded Ariel.
**Ariel:** "They are loud. Their energy is wild."

*A Lion pounced.*
Ariel didn't see it. He felt a spike of **Red Aggression** at 4 o'clock.
**Ariel:** "Right!"
He dodged right. The claw missed.

*An Elephant swung its trunk.*
**Intent:** Heavy. Slow. Crushing.
Ariel ducked.

**The Lesson:**
**Rayleigh:** *"Don't wait for the movement. Wait for the Will. The Will travels faster than the body."*

Ariel spent four hours dodging beasts in the dark. He got hit. He got trampled.
But by the end, he wasn't reacting. He was **Predicting**.
He felt the intent form in the beast's mind, and he moved before they did.

**Ariel:** "I can see them. I can see the red sparks of their anger."

### Night: The Integration (Module 7 & 8)

**Time:** 11:00 PM.

Ariel disconnected. He was mentally exhausted, but his senses were wide open.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
He sat in his room. He kept the "Haki Radar" active.
He sensed a cockroach in the kitchen.
He sensed his neighbor watching TV.
He sensed the flow of electricity in the walls.

**Ariel:** "I'm ready. The church is dark. Perfect for a radar."

**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He calmed the sensory overload. He focused on **Issei's** signature—a chaotic, burning red light in the distance.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow, we go in. I'll be the eyes. You be the fist."

---

### 📊 Day 17 Stats:

* **PHY:** 2.1 (Reinforced by Ki).
* **MND:** 7.0 (Sensory processing optimized).
* **SPR:** 1.5 (**Observation Haki: Basic** unlocked. Can sense Presence and Intent).
* **Status:** Radar online. Prep complete.

### Evening: The Beast and The Intent (PTD Module 22 - Part 2 Extended)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** PTD Interface (Rusukaina Jungle).

The simulation shifted. Ariel wasn't alone with Rayleigh anymore.
A boy with a straw hat and bandages appeared. **Luffy**.
**Rayleigh:** *"Two students. Same lesson. Dodge."*

**1. The Energy Signature (Aura Reading)**
The beasts surrounded them.
**Rayleigh:** *"Look deeper. It isn't just 'Anger.' It is the frequency of their life."*
Ariel focused.

* **The Lion:** Sharp, jagged aura. Fast spikes. Like static electricity.
* **The Gorilla:** Dense, heavy aura. A rolling boulder.
* **The Snake:** Cold, thin aura. Slippery. Hard to pin down.

**Ariel:** "I can classify them. I don't need to see the shape. The signature tells me the species."

**2. The Intent (The Spark)**
Luffy was laughing, dodging effortlessly.
*Luffy:* "Whoa! That one was spicy!"
Ariel watched (with his mind's eye). Luffy moved before the aura even fully flared.
**Rayleigh:** *"He senses the desire. Before the lion decides to bite, it *wants* to bite. That want is a signal."*

Ariel synced his breathing.
*A tiger crouched.*
Ariel felt a **red ping** in the void. *Intent: Kill.*
He side-stepped. The tiger flew past.
**Ariel:** "Got it. The thought precedes the action."

**3. The Five Senses Integration (The Challenge)**
**Rayleigh:** *"Now. Open your eyes."*
Ariel removed the blindfold.
The jungle was bright. Noisy. Chaotic.
**Rayleigh:** *"The eyes lie. The ears get overwhelmed. Do not let the light blind your Haki. Layer the senses."*

**The Drill:**
Ariel had to dodge while:

1. **Seeing:** The swaying trees (Distraction).
2. **Hearing:** The roaring wind (Noise).
3. **Sensing:** The Intent (Truth).

*A Leopard jumped from the shadows.*

* **Eyes:** Saw a blur of spots. (Too slow).
* **Ears:** Heard a rustle. (Too late).
* **Haki:** Felt the killing intent 0.5 seconds ago.

Ariel trusted the **Haki**. He ignored his eyes telling him "It's far away" and ducked. The claws raked the air where his head was.
**Ariel:** "Vision is just confirmation. Haki is the warning."

He fought back-to-back with Luffy for hours.
Luffy used rubber elasticity. Ariel used **CQC** and **Ki Reinforcement**.
Together, they cleared the clearing.

**Luffy:** (Grinning) "You're getting better, Shishishishi!"
**Ariel:** "Trying to keep up with the Pirate King is a workout."

Ariel wiped sweat from his brow.
**Ariel:** "My eyes aren't a liability anymore. They are just another sensor in the array."

---

### 📊 Updated Day 17 Stats

* **Skill Unlocked:** **Integrated Perception.** (Can use Observation Haki with eyes open without sensory overload).
* **Status:** Ready for the chaos of the Church Raid.

## Day 18 (Thursday): The Raid on the Church

### Morning: The Grand Cycle (Meditation)

**Time:** 5:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel sat in the center of his room. He wasn't using the PTD interface. He was integrating the software into his wetware (brain).
**[Module 8: Meditation]**

He closed his eyes and cycled through his "Drivers":

1. **The Mind (Solid Snake/Leon):** *Tactical assessment. Resource management. Fear suppression.*
2. **The Body (Tekken/MGS):** *CQC reflexes. Bone breaking. Disarming.*
3. **The Energy (Gohan):** *Golden Ki coursing through his meridians. Reinforcing skin and bone.*
4. **The Senses (Luffy/Rayleigh):** *Observation Haki. The Radar.*

He breathed in. The air felt heavy with information.
He breathed out. The golden aura flickered briefly around his skin.
**Ariel:** "System Check: Green. I am no longer a civilian."

### Lunch: The Trap (Event)

**Location:** The Cafeteria.

Issei was shaking. He slammed his phone on the table.
**Issei:** "She sent a message."

Ariel looked at the screen. A picture of Asia tied to a cross.
**Text:** *"Come alone, darling. Let's finish our date."*

**Ariel:** "It's a trap."
**Issei:** "I don't care! I'm going!"
**Ariel:** "I know. But we don't walk into traps blindly. We spring them on *our* terms."

**[Haki Scan (Low Level)]**
Ariel focused on the phone. He felt the residual energy on the digital file.
*Ariel:* "Malice. Arrogance. And... impatience."
**Ariel:** "She wants you there at sunset. That gives us 5 hours to prep."

### Afternoon: The Loadout (Preparation)

**Time:** 3:00 PM.
**Location:** Hardware Store / Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel didn't buy weapons this time. He bought **Conduits**.

* **Weighted Gloves:** Leather knuckles filled with lead shot.
* **Steel Baton (Collapsible):** Standard security issue.
* **Smoke Bombs (Homemade):** Sugar and Potassium Nitrate.

**The Enchantment (Module 21):**
He sat with his gear.
He held the steel baton. He poured his **Ki** into it.
*Ariel:* "Steel is too brittle against light magic. I need to coat it."
He wrapped the weapon in a thin film of energy. It wasn't a Noble Phantasm, but it would hold together for a few hits against a Light Spear.

**The Strategy:**
He met with Issei, Kiba, and Koneko (who decided to help against orders).
**Ariel:** "Issei is the bait. Kiba is the vanguard. Koneko is the siegebreaker. I am the Ghost."
**Kiba:** "The Ghost?"
**Ariel:** "I watch your backs. If something invisible attacks, I'll see it."

### Evening: The Raid (The Church)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** The Abandoned Church.

The sky was blood red. The building loomed like a skull.

**1. The Approach (Observation Haki)**
They stood at the gate.
**Issei:** "I'm going to kick the door down!"
**Ariel:** "Wait."
Ariel closed his eyes. **[Module 22: Radar]**.
The world turned into a wireframe grid in his mind.

* *Inside:* Four signals.
* *One Green (Asia).* Weak. Fading.
* *One Violet (Raynare).* High energy.
* *One Chaotic Purple (Freed).* Erratic. Moving on the ceiling.
* *Multiple Grey (Exorcists).* Fodder.

**Ariel:** "Freed is above the door. Ambush position. Kiba, take high guard."

**2. The Breach**
Issei kicked the door. *CRASH.*
**Freed:** "Amen, sinners!"
Freed dropped from the ceiling, light sword slashing.
**Kiba:** "Got him!"
Kiba intercepted. Sparks flew.

**3. The Melee (Ariel vs. Exorcists)**
Lower-level exorcists rushed Issei.
Issei was struggling to summon his gear.
Ariel stepped in.
**[Module 19: Tekken Style - Mishima Karate]**
He didn't use a weapon. He used the **Weighted Gloves** + **Ki Reinforcement**.
*Exorcist swings a sword.*
Ariel sensed the intent. *Duck. Step in.*
**Ariel:** "Wind God Fist!"
He drove an uppercut into the exorcist’s gut. The Ki flared. The exorcist was launched three meters back, unconscious.
**Koneko:** (Watching) "Not bad."

**4. The Dungeon (The Ritual)**
They descended to the basement.
Raynare stood before the altar. Asia was hanging on the cross. The **Twilight Healing** was being extracted—a green light flowing into Raynare.
**Raynare:** "You're too late."

Issei charged. "**BOOST!**"
Raynare laughed. She had the healing factor now.
She threw a volley of Light Spears.

**Ariel:** "Eyes open!"
He activated **Integrated Perception** (Haki + Vision).
He saw the trajectory of every spear before it left her hand.
**Ariel:** "Kiba, 2 o'clock! Koneko, low!"
He directed the team like a traffic controller.

**5. The Confrontation (Round 2)**
Raynare focused on Ariel.
**Raynare:** "The worm survived? And you brought a stick?"
She saw his collapsible baton.

**Ariel:** "It's not just a stick."
He extended it. *Snick.*
He channeled his **Ki**. The baton glowed with a faint golden aura (Reinforcement).
**Ariel:** "It's a conductor."

Raynare swooped down.
**Raynare:** "Die!"
She stabbed with a Light Spear.
Last time, Ariel’s weapon melted.
This time, **Ki met Magic**.
*CLANG.*
The baton held. The energy coating repelled the light.

Ariel didn't recoil. He used **[Module 16: CQC]**.
He deflected the spear to the side, stepped into her guard (The Boss style), and slammed the baton into her ribs.
*CRACK.*
**Raynare:** "Gah! How?!"

**Ariel:** "Upgrade."

**6. The End**
Issei reached Asia. But she was lifeless. The gear was gone.
Issei screamed. The Red Dragon Gauntlet evolved.
He charged Raynare in a berserker rage.

Ariel stood back. His baton was smoking, the metal finally giving way to the heat.
**Ariel:** "My job is done. The tank has aggro."

Rias Gremory arrived to finish the job and resurrect Asia.
Ariel watched from the shadows. He saw Rias claim Asia as a Bishop.
He felt the **King's Aura** from Rias. It was massive.
**Ariel:** (Internal) *That is the power ceiling. I'm barely at the floorboards.*

He sheathed his melted baton.
**Ariel:** "Mission Accomplished. VIP secured."

---

### 📊 Day 18 Stats (End of Arc):

* **PHY:** 2.3 (Reinforced).
* **MND:** 7.5 (Battle Hardened).
* **SPR:** 2.0 (Ki Coating & Observation Haki Basics applied in combat).
* **TEC:** 8.5 (Successfully synthesized modern weaponry with Ki).
* **Status:** **Fallen Angel Arc Complete.** Ariel proved he can fight supernatural entities without a Sacred Gear.

## Day 18 (Evening): The Two-Man Army

**Location:** The Abandoned Church.
**Time:** 7:00 PM.

### 1. The Breach (MGS: Tactical Espionage Action)

Ariel and Issei stood at the heavy oak doors. Issei was shaking, clutching his left hand.
**Issei:** "Just the two of us? Against Fallen Angels?"
**Ariel:** "Numbers don't matter, Issei. Positioning matters. Put on the goggles."

Ariel handed Issei a pair of tinted industrial goggles (bought at the hardware store). Ariel put on his own.
**Ariel:** "On my mark. Kick. Then duck."

**Ariel's Internal Monologue:**
*MND 7.5: Enemy probable location: Altar. Acoustics: High echo. Lighting: Dim.*
*Strategy: Shock and Awe.*

**Ariel:** "Breach."

*CRASH.* Issei kicked the doors open.
**Issei:** "RAYNARE!"

The Fallen Angels (Raynare, Mittelt, Kalawarner) and Freed Sellzen looked up.
**Freed:** "Visitors? I didn't order pizza!"

Ariel didn't speak. He threw four **Flashbangs** (Magnesium Flares + Strobe lights taped together).
*FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.*
The church turned blinding white. The Fallen Angels screamed, covering their eyes. The Exorcists were stunned.
Only Ariel and Issei (wearing goggles) could see.

**Ariel:** "Go! Left flank!"

### 2. The Priest vs. The Soldier (CQC & Weapon Mastery)

Issei ran for Asia. **Freed Sellzen** dropped from the ceiling, swinging his Light Sword blindly but fast.
**Freed:** "I can hear you, little rats!"

He aimed for Issei.
Ariel intercepted.
**[Module 13: Burst Speed] + [Module 16: CQC]**
Ariel slid under Freed's guard like a baseball player sliding for home base.
He extended his **Collapsible Baton**.
**[Module 21: Ki Reinforcement]**
Golden Ki wrapped around the steel baton, hardening it against the Light Sword.

*CLANG.*
Ariel parried the strike upward.
He rolled to his feet, standing between Freed and Issei.

**Freed:** "A human? With a stick? You're mocking me!"
Freed lunged, a flurry of thrusts.
Ariel didn't block; he **Flowed**.
**[Module 10: Tekken - Dragunov Style]**
He side-stepped. *Parry. Deflect. Check.*
Every time Freed swung, Ariel tapped the blade away with the baton, wasting minimum energy.

**Ariel:** "You overextend. Your stance is wide. Amateur."

**Freed:** "SHUT UP!"
Freed went for a heavy overhead swing.
**Ariel:** "Trap triggered."
Ariel stepped *in*. He dropped the baton and grabbed Freed's wrist with both hands.
**[The Boss's CQC: The Disarm]**
He twisted Freed's wrist against the joint. He swept the leg.
*CRUNCH.*
Freed slammed into the stone floor. The Light Sword skittered away.

Ariel drew his **Utility Knife** and drove it into Freed's shoulder (non-lethal, disabling the arm).
**Ariel:** "Stay down."

### 3. The Angel's Wrath (Observation Haki)

**Raynare:** "Useless priest."
Raynare recovered from the flash. She flew into the air.
**Raynare:** "I'll kill you both!"
She summoned five Light Spears.

**Issei:** "Ariel! Look out!"

Ariel looked up.
**[Module 22: Observation Haki (Basic)]**
He closed his eyes for a split second. The world turned into a wireframe grid.
He felt the **Intent**.
*Spear 1: Left shoulder.*
*Spear 2: Right knee.*
*Spear 3: Issei.*

**Ariel:** "Issei! Roll right!"
Issei rolled. *THOOM.* A spear decimated the floor where he stood.

Ariel didn't roll. He moved with **Minimal Effort**.
He tilted his head. *Zip.* Spear 1 missed.
He lifted his leg. *Zip.* Spear 2 passed under him.

**Raynare:** "What?! Stop dodging!"
She threw a volley. It was a rain of light.

**Ariel:** "I can't dodge them all. **Iron Body.**"
**[Module 20: Ki Hardening + Iron Body]**
Ariel crossed his arms over his head. He flooded his skin with Golden Ki.
*CRASH. CRASH.*
Two spears hit his arms. The Ki flared, dissipating the light energy. His sleeves burned off, and his skin blistered, but the bone held.

**Ariel:** "Issei! Get Asia! I'll hold the aggro!"
Ariel picked up a pew (bench) and threw it at Raynare to keep her busy.
**Ariel:** "Hey! Pigeon! Down here!"

### 4. The Limit (The Sacrifice)

Issei reached Asia. The extraction was halfway done.
Raynare realized she was losing.
**Raynare:** "Annoying flies."

She gathered a massive amount of light energy. **Great Light Spear.**
She didn't aim at Ariel. She aimed at **Asia**.

**Raynare:** "If I can't have the gear, no one can!"

**Ariel's Calculation:**
*Distance: Too far to throw a weapon.*
*Issei: Distracted.*
*Trajectory: Fatal.*
*Solution: **Body Block**.*

Ariel sprinted. **[Module 13: Parkour]**.
He jumped off the altar steps, launching himself into the air in front of Asia.

**Ariel:** "SHIELD!"
He didn't just block; he **Rotated**.
He spun his body to take the impact on his back, protecting his vital organs (Heart/Lungs) with his ribcage and shoulder blades.

*KA-BOOM.*

The Great Spear hit Ariel mid-air.
The Ki Shield shattered.
The Iron Body cracked.
The spear went through his left shoulder, pinning him to the ground.

**Ariel:** "GAAAAH!"

**Issei:** "ARIEL!"

### 5. The Aftermath

The dust cleared.
Ariel lay on the ground, bleeding heavily. The spear had missed his heart by inches thanks to his rotation.
Raynare landed, laughing.
**Raynare:** "Got you."

She walked over to finish him.
**Issei:** "Get... away... from him!"
The **Boosted Gear** exploded with green light. The Dragon awoke, fueled by the sight of his fallen tactician.
Issei punched Raynare. It wasn't technique. It was pure **Emotion**.
Raynare flew back, crashing into the wall.

**The Cavalry:**
The crimson circle appeared. **Rias Gremory** and her peerage stepped out.
Rias saw the scene: Issei standing guard over a broken Ariel. Asia unconscious but alive.
**Rias:** "You hurt my Pawn. And you hurt his friend."
Her aura disintegrated the pews. **Power of Destruction.**
Raynare fled, terrified of the King.

**Rias:** "Akeno, secure the perimeter. Asia... Asia, wake up. I need you to heal him."

Rias knelt beside Ariel. She placed her hand on the spear.
**Rias:** "Hold still."
She dissolved the spear. Ariel gritted his teeth, refusing to pass out.
**Ariel:** "Did... we... win?"

Rias looked at him. She saw the tactical vest, the flashlights, the melted baton. She realized he hadn't just fought; he had *orchestrated* the battle.

**Rias:** "Yes. You won."
She smiled, a mix of respect and concern.
**Rias:** "You are reckless, Ariel Veritas. But you are effective."

Ariel closed his eyes, finally letting the darkness take him.
**Ariel:** "Good. Mission... complete."

---

### 📝 Narrative Impact

This version solidifies Ariel as the **Heroic Equal**.

* He didn't need Kiba or Koneko to survive (initially).
* He used **Tekken**, **MGS**, and **DBZ** concepts to fight a supernatural war.
* He earned Rias's respect not by being powerful, but by being **Competent**.

### The Resurrection of the Bishop

**Location:** The Altar of the Abandoned Church.
**Status:** Raynare fled. Ariel is down. Issei is holding Asia.

Issei held Asia in his arms. She was pale, her breathing shallow. The extraction ritual had drained her life force completely.
**Issei:** "Asia! Hang on! Open your eyes!"
**Asia:** "Issei-san... Ariel-san... thank you... for coming for me..."
Her hand went limp. Her heart stopped.

**Issei:** "NO! BUCHOU! DO SOMETHING!"

Rias walked over. She looked at Asia with a somber expression.
**Rias:** "The Sacred Gear was ripped out. Her soul is untethered. As a human... she is gone."

**Issei:** "You're a Devil! You can do anything! Bring her back!"

Rias knelt. She summoned a glowing red box. She opened it to reveal a chess piece radiating magical energy.
**The Bishop.**

**Rias:** "I can bring her back. But not as a human. She will become a Devil. She will be my servant. She will never be able to return to the Church she loves."
Rias looked at Issei.
**Rias:** "Is that what you want? To bind her to us?"

Issei didn't hesitate.
**Issei:** "I don't care about the Church! I just want her to live! Please!"

Ariel, watching from the floor through blurry vision, nodded weakly.
**Ariel:** "Save... her."

Rias smiled softly.
**Rias:** "Very well. In the name of Rias Gremory..."

She placed the Bishop piece on Asia’s chest. It sank into her body.
Crimson light enveloped the girl. Her breathing returned. Her skin regained color.
The **Bishop Piece** had been used.

**Ariel's Internal Monologue (Fading out):**
*Issei is the Pawn. Asia is the Bishop. The board is filling up.*
*And I... I'm just the spectator who bought the ticket.*

---

**Result:**

* **Asia Argento** is resurrected as a **Devil (Bishop)**.
* She now lives at the Hyoudou Residence.
* She joins the Occult Research Club.

## Day 19 (Friday): The Respect of Kings and The Open Door

### Morning: The Hospital Awakening (Module 7 & 20)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
**Location:** Kuoh General Hospital – Room 304.

Ariel woke up. The pain was dull, muffled by Rias's healing magic.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**

* *Left Shoulder:* Tissue knit together. Bone stabilized. Mobility 40%.
* *Energy:* Low.
* *Mind:* Clear.

**Ariel:** "I survived. Raynare failed. Mission Success."

He sat up. He didn't wait for a nurse. He started doing **[Module 20: Bio-Feedback]**.
He cycled his **Golden Ki** (faint) to the injury site.
*Ariel:* "Accelerate cell division. Reduce inflammation."
He visualized the bone hardening like steel.
**[System Update: Healing accelerated. Estimated full recovery: 3 Days.]**

### Midday: The Visitors (Social)

**Time:** 12:00 PM.

The door opened. It wasn't just Rias. It was the **Squad**.
**Issei**, **Asia**, **Kiba**, and **Koneko**.
Issei ran in first.
**Issei:** "Ariel! You're awake! You look... surprisingly okay!"

Ariel smiled. "Takes more than a light spear to keep me down, Issei. How's Asia?"

Asia stepped forward, bowing deeply. She wore the Kuoh uniform.
**Asia:** "I am well, Ariel-san! Thanks to you! I... I am a Devil now!"
She showed her Bishop Piece (aura).

**Ariel:** "It suits you. Better than the nun habit."
Asia blushed happily.

**Kiba** walked to the bedside. He looked at Ariel with genuine respect.
**Kiba:** "That move you did... disarming Freed with a baton. That was impressive. Most people freeze when they see a light sword."
**Ariel:** "Freed telegraphs his swings. He's emotional."

**Koneko** placed a bag of candy on the table.
**Koneko:** "You fought well. For a squishy."
**Ariel:** "Thanks, Koneko. I'll work on the 'squishy' part."

### The King's Conversation (The Divergence)

The group chattered for a while, then Rias cleared her throat.
**Rias:** "Everyone, give us a moment. I need to speak to Ariel alone regarding... insurance."

The group left. Rias pulled up a chair. Her demeanor was serious but warm.
**Rias:** "Ariel. I reviewed the incident. You engaged two Fallen Angels and an Exorcist. You utilized advanced combat tactics and what appeared to be... Life Force manipulation (Ki)."

**Ariel:** (Veritas) "I dabble."

**Rias:** "You are an anomaly. Usually, I erase the memories of humans involved in our world. It protects them."

Ariel watched her. He waited for the pity.
But Rias didn't pity him. She looked at him like a **Recruit**.

**Rias:** "But erasing your memory would be a waste of talent. You have the mind of a Tactician. And the will of a Warrior."
She leaned forward.
**Rias:** "I am not offering you a Piece yet. You are still fragile. But... I am offering you **Access**."

**Ariel:** "Access?"

**Rias:** "The Old School Building has a gym. It has a library of occult texts. If you wish to continue this... 'Training' of yours... you may use our facilities. Under my supervision."

Ariel grinned. This wasn't charity. This was an investment.
**Ariel:** "You want me to be the strategist."

**Rias:** "Issei is powerful, but he is blunt. Kiba is fast, but reckless. We need a brain. If you train with us, perhaps you can keep them alive."

**Ariel:** "Deal. But I'm doing it my way. No magic circles. Just sweat."

**Rias:** "Agreed. Heal up, Ariel. We have work to do."

### Afternoon: The PTD Upgrade (Module 5 & 20)

**Time:** 4:00 PM.
**Location:** Hospital Room (Alone).

Rias left. Ariel was alone.
He didn't feel lonely. He felt **Eager**.
**[Command: PTD Interface]**

**Ariel:** "System. I fought a Fallen Angel. I survived. Unlock the next tier."

**[System Update: Combat Data Integrated.]**
**[New Module Available: Module 23 (Will / Haki Foundations).]**
**[Reason:]** *User displayed significant Willpower in resisting the Light Spear impact.*

Ariel looked at the new menu.
**Ariel:** "Haki. Finally."
He couldn't use it yet (Stats too low), but the *Tutorial* was unlocked.

**[Module 20: Ki Control]**
He practiced circulating Ki while bedridden.
*Ariel:* "Rias called me fragile. She's right. Next time... I won't need a baton to block a spear. I'll use my arm."

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Remote)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.

Issei texted him a picture of the dinner at his house. Rias, Akeno, Asia, all eating together.
**Text:** *"Wish you were here, bro! Saved you some cake!"*

Ariel texted back: *"Eat it. You need the calories. See you Monday."*

Ariel didn't feel left out. He felt like the **Guy in the Chair**. The one who makes sure the heroes get to have dinner.
**Ariel:** "They celebrate. I calibrate."

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I fight **Roronoa Zoro**. I need to learn how to fight through pain. I need to learn **Endurance**."

He slept, dreaming of swords and steel.

* **SPR:** 2.2 (Ki capacity increasing).
* **Status:** **The Tactician.** Accepted as an unofficial member of the Gremory Group.

## Day 19 (Friday): The Guest Pass and The Training Buddy

### Morning: The Hospital Awakening (Module 7 & 20)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
**Location:** Kuoh General Hospital – Room 304.

Ariel woke up. The healing magic had done its work.
**[Module 20: Bio-Feedback]**
He cycled his faint Golden Ki to flush out the last of the stiffness.
*Ariel:* "I'm functional. Not 100%, but combat effective."

### Midday: The Visitors (The Squad)

**Time:** 12:00 PM.

The door opened. **Issei**, **Asia**, **Kiba**, and **Koneko** entered.
**Issei:** "Ariel! You're alive! Man, you took that spear like a champ!"

Ariel grinned. "Someone had to be the meat shield. You're the DPS (Damage Dealer), Issei."

**Asia:** "I am so glad you are safe! I... I am a Devil now!"
She showed her Bishop piece.
**Ariel:** "It suits you. You have a home now."

**Kiba:** "That move with the baton... Parrying light? That wasn't luck."
**Ariel:** "It was physics. Light has mass. If you hit it hard enough, it deflects."
**Koneko:** "You're weird. But tough."

### The King's Visit (The Revised Offer)

The group chattered. Then, **Rias** entered.
The room quieted.
**Rias:** "Ariel. I see you are recovering well."

**Ariel:** "Thanks to your healing, President."

**Rias:** "I wanted to discuss your status."
She sat down. She didn't look at him like a subordinate; she looked at him like a puzzle she couldn't solve.

**Rias:** "You fought Raynare. You survived. Usually, I erase the memories of humans involved in our affairs."

**Ariel:** "I know. Issei told me." (Bluffing/Veritas). "But I'd prefer to keep my head intact."

**Rias:** "I agree. Erasing your memory would be... wasteful. You protected my servant when he was vulnerable."

She crossed her arms.
**Rias:** "However, I cannot have a civilian running around fighting Fallen Angels. It complicates things."

**Ariel:** "I'm not looking for trouble, Rias. But Issei attracts trouble. And I'm not going to let him die just because I'm 'Civillian'."

Rias sighed. She looked at Issei, who was looking at Ariel with puppy-dog eyes.
**Rias:** "Fine. Here is the arrangement."

**The Offer:**
**Rias:** "You are allowed to know about Devils. You are allowed to visit the clubroom as Issei's guest. You may use our gym facilities if you wish."
**Ariel:** "And in exchange?"
**Rias:** "In exchange, you help Issei. He listens to you. Keep him focused. If he slacks off, you have my permission to... correct him."

**Ariel:** (Smiling) "So I'm his workout buddy."
**Rias:** "Essentially. But do not think this makes you a Devil, Ariel. You are still human. If a High-Class threat appears... you run. Do we understand each other?"

**Ariel:** "Loud and clear. I stick to the gym."

**Rias:** "Good."

### Afternoon: The PTD Upgrade (Module 5 & 20)

**Time:** 4:00 PM.
**Location:** Hospital Room (Alone).

Ariel was satisfied.
**Ariel:** "I have access. I have a safe zone. And I have Rias's blessing to train Issei."

**[Command: PTD Interface]**
**[System Update: Combat Data Integrated.]**
**[New Module Available: Module 23 (Will / Haki Foundations).]**
**[Reason:]** *User displayed significant Willpower in resisting the Light Spear impact.*

**Ariel:** "Haki. Finally."

He couldn't use it yet (Stats too low), but the *Tutorial* was unlocked.

**[Module 20: Ki Control]**
He practiced circulating Ki while bedridden.
*Ariel:* "Rias sees me as a helper. That's fine. It lowers her guard. While she plays politics, I'll be in her gym getting stronger than her Knight."

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Remote)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.

Issei texted him a picture of the dinner at his house.
**Text:** *"Mom loves Rias! Dad is crying tears of joy! Save me!"*

Ariel texted back: *"Survive. See you Monday."*

**Ariel:** "No envy. Just relief. He's safe."
He didn't feel left out. He felt like he had secured the base.
**Ariel:** "Now I can focus on the grind."

### Night: The Dream of the Pirate Hunter (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I fight **Roronoa Zoro** (East Blue Arc). I need to learn **Endurance**. I need to learn how to take a cut and keep moving."

He slept, dreaming of swords and steel.

## Day 20 (Saturday): The Golden Flow and The Devil's Gym

### Morning: The Discharge (Module 7 & 3)

**Time:** 8:00 AM.
**Location:** Kuoh General Hospital / The Streets.

Ariel signed the discharge papers. The doctors were baffled by his recovery speed ("Must be youth," they muttered), but Ariel knew it was **[Module 20: Bio-Feedback]**.

He walked out into the sunlight. The air tasted sweet.
**Ariel:** "I lost the fight. But I unlocked the server."

**[Module 3: Daily Movement]**
He didn't take a taxi. He ran home.
He tested his healed shoulder. He rotated his arm while jogging.
*Sensation:* A slight stiffness, but the structural integrity was higher than before. The bone had calcified denser.
**Ariel:** "What doesn't kill me... adds to my defense stat."

### Midday: The Curriculum Update (PTD)

**Time:** 11:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

He threw his bag on the floor and sat in the center of his room.
**[Command: PTD Interface]**
**[Level 2 Unlocked: Fiction Archives Available]**

Ariel reviewed his fight with Raynare.
**Analysis:**

1. **Speed:** Adequate for burst, poor for sustained combat against flight.
2. **Defense:** **Iron Body (Physical)** failed against **Light Magic**.
3. **Offense:** **CQC** worked on Freed (Human), failed on Raynare (Supernatural Durability).

**The Pivot:**
**Ariel:** "I need a multiplier. Physics isn't enough. I need to enforce my own physics."

He selected his new Training Path: **The Pure Martial Artist.**

* **Defense:** **Armament Haki** (Invisible Armor to block magic).
* **Offense:** **Ki Reinforcement** (To hurt things that are durable).
* **Style:** **Flowing Water Rock Smashing Fist** (Deflecting power rather than tanking it).

### Afternoon: The Authorized Guest (Event)

**Time:** 2:00 PM.
**Location:** The Old School Building Gym.

Ariel walked into the ORC clubhouse. He wasn't sneaking in through a vent; he walked in the front door.
**Issei** was there, doing pushups (bad form). **Koneko** was eating. **Kiba** was polishing a sword.

**Issei:** "Ariel! You're out! You came!"
**Ariel:** "Rias gave me a pass. I'm not wasting it."

**The Interaction (Kiba):**
Kiba walked over.
**Kiba:** "Welcome back. I admit, I was surprised Rias allowed a human to use our facilities."
**Ariel:** "She needs someone to make sure Issei doesn't break his back lifting with his ego. Speaking of..."

Ariel walked over to Issei.
**Ariel:** "Issei, your elbows are flared. You're destroying your rotator cuffs. Tuck them in. Engage the triceps."
He corrected Issei's form. Issei groaned but pushed up easier.
**Issei:** "Whoa. That's actually easier."

**The Interaction (Koneko):**
Ariel approached Koneko.
**Ariel:** "Toujou-san. You hit me with a Rook punch last week. It hurt."
**Koneko:** "You were peeping."
**Ariel:** "Fair. But I noticed something. You rely on density. If I had moved *with* your punch instead of blocking it, I wouldn't have flown into the wall."

Koneko paused. She put down her cookie.
**Koneko:** "Show me."

**The Spar (Light):**
Koneko threw a slow, heavy punch.
Ariel didn't use **Iron Body**. He used **[Module 19: Tai Chi / Flow]**.
He caught her wrist, rotated his hips, and guided her fist past his head.
**Ariel:** "Water flows around the rock."

Koneko looked at her fist. Then at Ariel.
**Koneko:** "Not bad. For a pervert."
**Ariel:** "I'm a *retired* pervert. Now I'm just a gym rat."

### Evening: The Engine (Module 20 & 21)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

He returned home buzzing with the successful integration.
**Ariel:** "Now, the battery."

**[Module 21: Inner Energy (Ki)]**
He sat in the lotus position.
Unlike Ren (who sought the Void), Ariel sought the **Core**.
He visualized the **Sun**. Warmth. Circulation. Life.

*Breathing:* Deep, rhythmic diaphragm expansion.
*Visualization:* Golden liquid filling his stomach (Dantian).

He felt it. The heat he had touched during the Videl simulation.
It wasn't dark or cold. It was **Hot**. It felt like drinking coffee straight from the pot.
**Ariel:** "Flow."

He pushed the heat into his right hand. His hand glowed faintly red under the skin.
He chopped a wooden block he kept for training.
*CRACK.*
It split effortlessly. No pain in his hand. The Ki took the impact.
**Ariel:** "Ki Reinforcement: Level 1. It acts as a glove."

### Night: The Dream of the Silver Fang (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

He lay in bed.
**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I learn Flow."

**Scenario:** *The Dojo on the Mountain.*
**Instructor:** **Bang (Silver Fang)** from *One Punch Man*.
**Style:** *Flowing Water Rock Smashing Fist.*

In the dream, Bang attacked him with a flurry of strikes.
**Bang:** *"Do not clash! Repel! Parry! Turn their power into your power!"*
Ariel spent the night getting hit, learning to use his hands like rivers to wash away the force of the attacks.

## Day 21 (Sunday): The Moving Day and The Golden River

### Morning: The Heavy Lifting (Module 3 & 14)

**Time:** 9:00 AM.
**Location:** Hyoudou Residence.

A truck arrived. Rias had ordered furniture and belongings for Asia.
**Issei:** "So many boxes! Asia-chan, what is in these?"
**Asia:** "Scriptures! And... Rias-buchou bought me cute clothes!"

Issei struggled with a heavy box of books. "Guh! Heavy!"

**Ariel:** "It's not heavy, Issei. It's resistance."

Ariel stepped in. He wasn't wearing his tactical gear; he was in a tank top and gym shorts.
**[Module 14: Muscle Training - Functional Strength]**
He picked up two boxes.
**Ariel:** "Engage the core. Lift with the legs. Keep the spine neutral."

He walked up the stairs.
**Rias:** "Ariel-kun, you don't have to help. I can use magic to float them."
**Ariel:** "And miss a leg day? Never, President. Gravity is free gym membership."

He treated the move like a workout. He timed his trips up and down the stairs.
*Issei:* "He's treating my house like a CrossFit box."
*Asia:* "Ariel-san is very strong!"

**Analysis:**
Ariel wasn't serving them (Ren's perspective). He was **training with them**. He turned a chore into a challenge.

### Midday: The Internal Plumbing (Module 21 - Blockages)

**Time:** 2:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

The moving was done. Ariel returned home, sweating and pumped.
**Ariel:** "Muscles are warm. Blood is flowing. Perfect time to clear the pipes."

**[Module 21: Inner Energy / Meridian Clearing]**
He sat on the floor.
**Goal:** Clear the **Leg Meridians** (Stomach/Spleen Channels) to prepare for **Flash Step / Shunpo**.

He closed his eyes. He visualized the **Golden Ki** in his gut.
*Ariel:* "It's a river. Right now, there are rocks in the way. Flood it."

He pushed the energy down his hips.
*Resistance.* A sharp, cramping pain in his thighs.
Unlike Ren (who drilled with a cold screw), Ariel used **Heat**. He visualized the energy expanding, warming the muscles until the tension melted.

*Push. Breathe. Push.*

He felt a sudden release in his left knee. A rush of warmth traveled to his toes.
**Ariel:** "Left channel open. Flow efficiency increased by 15%."

He spent three hours sweating through the pain, forcing his nervous system to accept the high-voltage bio-electricity.

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Event / Social)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** Hyoudou Residence.

Ariel returned for dinner. The house was lively.
**Issei's Dad:** "Ariel-kun! You helped so much today! Eat up!"
**Ariel:** "Thank you, sir! Protein is essential!"

**The Atmosphere:**
Rias was acting the perfect wife. Akeno was teasing Issei. Koneko was eating.
Ariel sat next to **Kiba**.
**Ariel:** "Good food, right?"
**Kiba:** "It is. It's... lively."

**Akeno's Move:**
Akeno leaned over Ariel.
**Akeno:** "Ara ara. You worked so hard today, Ariel-kun. You're all stiff. Do you need a special massage?"

**Ariel:** (Genuine Enthusiasm) "Actually, yes! My hip flexors are tight from the meridian clearing! Do you know how to do a deep tissue release? You have to use your elbow!"

Akeno blinked. "My... elbow?"
**Ariel:** "Yeah! Dig it right into the iliopsoas! It hurts like hell but it clears the blockage instantly!"
**Akeno:** (Sweatdrop) "I... see. Perhaps later."

**Rias:** (Giggling) "He treats you like a physiotherapist, Akeno."
**Ariel:** "A good physiotherapist is worth their weight in gold."

Ariel enjoyed the dinner. He saw Issei happy. He saw Asia safe.
**Ariel:** "Mission successful. The VIPs are secure."

### Night: The Weight Dropped (Module 9 - Inspiration)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

He lay in bed. His legs buzzed with the new energy flow.
**Ariel:** "I have the flow. Now I need the speed."

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I train with **Rock Lee**."

**Scenario:** *The Chunin Exams Arena.*
**The Moment:** Rock Lee dropping the weights.
In the dream, Ariel wore heavy weights on his legs.
**Lee:** *"The Lotus blooms twice, Ariel-kun! Take them off!"*
Ariel removed the mental limiters.
*BOOM.*
The weights hit the ground.
Ariel moved. He vanished.
**Ariel:** "Speed isn't just muscles. It's removing the mental brakes."

---

Ariel tested his new leg meridians.
**[Module 3: Daily Movement] + [Module 21: Inner Energy]**
He ran.
*Push.*
He channeled **Golden Ki** into his calves.
He didn't just run faster; he felt *lighter*. Each step propelled him further.
**Ariel:** "I'm not Rock Lee yet. But I'm faster than the track team."

### School: The Transfer (Event)

**Location:** Class 2-B. 08:30 AM.

The teacher introduced **Asia Argento**.
The class erupted.
**Ariel:** (Smiling) "She made it."

He watched Issei beam with pride.
*Ariel:* "Good. He has something to protect. That will make him stronger."

### Lunch: The Jealousy Meeting (Event)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

Matsuda and Motohama were weeping.
**Matsuda:** "Issei! You traitor! You live with a blonde angel?!"
**Motohama:** "Execute him! The court of perverts demands blood!"

Issei was panicking. "Guys! It's not like that! She's just... a friend!"

Ariel sat with them, eating a balanced bento.
**Ariel:** "Gentlemen, look at the data. Issei survived a Fallen Angel attack. He deserves a win."

**Matsuda:** "Ariel! Whose side are you on?!"

**Ariel:** "I'm on the side of logic. Besides..."
Ariel pointed at Issei.
**Ariel:** "Look at his face. He's terrified. He lives with Rias Gremory. Do you know how scary she is when she's angry?"

The Trio paused. They imagined Rias angry.
**Motohama:** "My condolences, Issei. Rest in peace."
**Issei:** "Hey! Why is everyone assuming I'm going to die?!"

**Ariel:** (Internal) *Because you're a harem protagonist. Danger is part of the job description.*

### Afternoon: The Tea Party (Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

The full peerage gathered. Rias sat at her desk. Akeno served tea.
Asia was officially welcomed.

**Rias:** "Welcome to the club, Ariel-kun."
**Ariel:** "Thanks for the guest pass, President."

**The Contract Briefing:**
Rias explained the contract system to Issei.
**Issei:** "So I just... fulfill wishes?"
**Ariel:** "Like a genie. But with less blue paint."

**Akeno:** "Ara ara. Issei-kun, you'll need a bicycle. Can you ride?"
**Issei:** "Of course!"

**Ariel's Role:**
While they discussed magic circles, Ariel walked over to the corner of the room.
He started doing **Handstand Pushups**.
**Koneko:** (Watching him) "Why?"
**Ariel:** "Gravity exists, Koneko-chan. Why waste it?"
**Koneko:** "Weirdo." But she sat near him and ate a cookie. They were bonding.

### Evening: The Clearing (Module 21)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

Issei went to do his contract.
Ariel went home.
**[Module 21: Inner Energy / Meridian Clearing]**
**Goal:** **Arm Meridians (Heart/Lung Channels)**.
*Why:* To punch harder. To channel Ki into weapons.

He sat on the floor. He pushed the Golden Ki into his shoulders.
*Burn.*
He visualized the blockage in his elbows shattering.
*Pop.*
A rush of heat flowed to his fingertips. His hands glowed faintly.
**Ariel:** "Arms open. Now I can reinforce my grip."

### Night: The Dream of the Fist (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

He lay in bed.

**Location:** The Route to School.

Ariel jogged with Issei.
**Issei:** "Contracts are tough! I have to deliver pizza tonight!"
**Ariel:** "Good for cardio, Issei. Just remember to engage your core on the bike."

Ariel practiced **[Module 21: Ki Circulation]** while running.
*Ariel:* "Heat. Flow. Legs."
He pushed Ki into his calves, lightening his step. He wasn't faster yet, but he was tireless.

### School: The Dual Processor (Module 8)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Ren (Route B) had used this time to meditate on the Void.
Ariel used it to optimize.
**[Module 8: Empty Mind]**
He listened to the lecture while visualizing his **Internal Map**.
*Ariel:* "Shoulder healed. Meridian flow: 60%. Hand Chakra: Unlocked."
He was treating his body like a machine undergoing a system defrag.

### Lunch: The Jealousy Meeting (Social)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

The Quartet gathered.
**Matsuda:** "Issei lives with two beauties! It's unfair!"
**Issei:** "It's not like that! Asia is like a little sister! And Rias is... Rias!"

Ariel ate his protein-heavy bento.
**Ariel:** "Focus, gentlemen. Jealousy burns calories. Use that energy for squats."
**Motohama:** "You're no fun since you got buff, Ariel."
**Ariel:** "I'm efficient."

### Afternoon: The Ara Ara Incident (Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

Ariel walked in. He was there to use the gym equipment (part of his deal with Rias).
**Akeno Himejima** was waiting. She saw Ariel stretching.
**Akeno:** "Ariel-kun. You're always so serious."

She walked up to him. She invaded his personal space, pressing her chest against his arm as he did bicep curls.
**Akeno:** "Ara ara. Your muscles are so tense. Do you want big sister to help you relax? Maybe a special massage?"

**Ariel's Reaction (Pure Shonen):**
In Route B, Ren analyzed her intent and deflected.
In Route A, Ariel **accepted the premise literally**.

**Ariel:** (Grinning brightly) "Oh, you know massage therapy? That’s awesome, Akeno-san! Recovery is key to muscle growth. But I usually use a foam roller. Do you have strong hands? You need a lot of grip strength to work out the deep tissue knots!"

Akeno blinked. She paused. "I... well, yes, but I meant..."

**Ariel:** "Great! Can you dig your elbow into my trap? Right here? It's been tight since the spear incident!"
He pointed to his shoulder, completely ignoring the sexual tension she was trying to build.

**Akeno:** (Sweatdrop) "You really... just want a massage?"
**Ariel:** "Sports medicine is vital, Akeno-san! If you help me, I can show you some stretches for your lower back! Flying must be hard on the lumbar spine!"

Akeno sighed, defeated by his purity.
**Akeno:** "Fine. Lie down. I'll fix your shoulder."
She actually gave him a massage. It was painful but effective.
**Ariel:** "Amazing! You have the hands of a healer!"
**Akeno:** (Blushing slightly) "Don't get used to it."

**Rias:** (Watching from her desk) *He neutralized Akeno. Impressive.*

### Evening: The Solo Grind (Module 10 & 20)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** The Old Gym.

Issei went to do contracts. Ariel stayed behind.
**[Module 10: Basic Martial Arts] + [Module 20: Ki Reinforcement]**

He practiced the **Ki Punch**.
*Stance.*
*Gather Ki in fist.*
*Strike.*
*BOOM.*
He hit the heavy bag. The bag didn't just swing; it indented deeply. The sound was like a gunshot.

**Ariel:** "Power is good. But Riser regenerates. I need sustained damage."
He started practicing **Rapid Fire Strikes** (Ora Ora style).
*Punch. Punch. Punch.*
He forced the Ki to flow continuously, not just in bursts.
**Ariel:** "If I can't kill him in one hit, I'll hit him a thousand times."

### Night: The Dream of the Gentle Fist (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

He returned home.
**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**

### Morning: The Dark King's Gauntlet (PTD Module 22 - Level 2)

**Time:** 5:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
**Instructor:** **Silvers Rayleigh**.
**Partner:** **Monkey D. Luffy**.

The jungle simulation faded. They stood in a white void.
**Rayleigh:** *"You can dodge a beast. A beast screams before it bites. A master whispers."*

He held a wooden staff.
**Rayleigh:** *"100 strikes. Don't use your eyes. Use your Haki."*

Ariel and Luffy put on blindfolds.
**[Module 22: Observation Haki (Advanced Attempt)]**

*Strike 1.*
Ariel felt a *sharp* intent. He dodged left.
*Whack.* The staff hit his shoulder.
**Ariel:** "Too slow!"
**Luffy:** "Ow! That hurt!"

*Strike 10.*
Rayleigh moved faster. He masked his intent. He didn't project "I will hit you"; he projected nothing until the moment of impact.
Ariel struggled. He was reacting to the air pressure, not the intent.
*Whack. Whack.*

*Strike 50.*
Ariel was bruised (simulated). He started to stop thinking.
**Ariel:** "Don't analyze. Just feel."
He felt a *void* in Rayleigh's aura. A gap where the staff would be.
He ducked. The staff missed.
**Rayleigh:** *"Good. Once."*

By strike 100, Ariel had dodged 15 times. Luffy had dodged 20.
It was a failure, but a productive one.
**Ariel:** "Humans are harder. They hide their souls."

### Lunch: The Knight's Invitation (Event)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

**Kiba Yuuto** approached Ariel.
**Kiba:** "Ariel-kun. I heard you were doing handstand pushups in the clubroom yesterday."
**Ariel:** "Gravity is free, Kiba."
**Kiba:** "I'm curious. Your reaction speed against Raynare... it wasn't normal. Would you spar with me? No magic. Just swords."
**Ariel:** "I don't have a sword."
**Kiba:** "I have wooden ones."

Ariel grinned.
**Ariel:** "You're on. But don't cry if I use CQC."

### Afternoon: The Dance of Steel (Module 10 & 22)

**Location:** The Old Gym. 3:30 PM.

They stood opposite each other.
**Kiba:** "Ready?"
*WHOOSH.*
Kiba moved at Knight speed. Even without magic, he was a blur.

**Ariel:** **[Integrated Perception (Eyes + Haki)]**
He remembered Rayleigh. *Don't look for the sword. Look for the intent.*
He felt Kiba's "Sharpness" move to the right.
Ariel stepped left.
*Miss.*

Kiba’s eyes widened. He spun and slashed.
Ariel used **[Module 10: Flow]**. He caught Kiba's wrist (not the sword) and redirected the momentum.
*Throw.*
Kiba flipped in the air and landed on his feet.
**Kiba:** "Amazing! You read me perfectly!"

They sparred for 20 minutes. Ariel was sweating; Kiba was barely winded.
**Ariel:** (Panting) "Okay... timeout. My stamina... isn't Devil-class yet."
**Kiba:** "That was the most fun I've had in weeks. You fight like a warrior, Ariel-kun."

### Late Afternoon: The Snack Time (Event: Koneko)

**Location:** Clubroom.

They walked in. **Koneko** was eating cookies. Issei and Asia were there.
**Koneko:** "You smell like sweat."
**Ariel:** "Sparring with the Prince."

Koneko held out a cookie.
**Koneko:** "Protein."
**Ariel:** "Thanks, Koneko-chan! Carbs are good too!"
He ate it happily.
**Issei:** "Why does she feed you?! I bought her cake!"
**Koneko:** "You're gross. He's working."

### Evening: The Energy Focus (Free Time / Module 21)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

Ariel returned home. He was sore from Kiba's speed.
**Ariel:** "I can see him. But my body is lagging. I need to be faster."

**[Module 21: Inner Energy / Reinforcement]**
He focused on his legs.
**Goal:** **Shunpo (Flash Step) / Soru.**
*Concept:* Kick the ground 10 times in a split second to generate explosive speed.
*Ariel:* "Reinforce the ankles with Ki. Otherwise, they snap."

He practiced explosive jumps in his room (landing softly with Ki Dampening).
*Jump. Land. Jump.*
He was building the **Fast-Twitch Muscle Fibers** required to match a Knight.

### Night: The Dream of the Speedster (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:30 PM.

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I race **Yoruichi Shihoin** (*Bleach*). I need to learn the Flash Step."

## Day 25 (Thursday): The Kinetic Queens and The High-Speed Eye

### Morning: The Visual Drill (Module 1, 3, & 22)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
**Location:** The Park.

Ariel stood still, holding a tennis ball.
**[Module 22: Observation Haki - Visual Tracking]**
He threw the ball against a wall. Hard.
He didn't catch it with his hands; he caught it with his *eyes*.
He forced his focus to track the spin, the deformation of the rubber upon impact, and the exact angle of the rebound.

**Ariel:** "If I can track a tennis ball at 100km/h, I can track a fist. But Devils move faster."

He spent an hour throwing faster and faster, reinforcing his optic nerves with **Ki** to prevent strain.

### School: The Hype (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B. Lunch.

Issei was vibrating.
**Issei:** "Ariel! Today is the day! The Tennis Match! Rias vs. Akeno!"
**Ariel:** "Is there a tournament?"
**Issei:** "No! Just a friendly match! But imagine... the outfits! The physics!"

**Ariel:** (Nodding seriously) "Physics indeed. High-velocity projectile tracking is excellent training for dynamic vision. Good call, Issei."
**Issei:** "Uh... yeah! Dynamic vision! Exactly!"

### Afternoon: The Match of Gods (Event)

**Location:** The School Tennis Courts. 4:00 PM.

A crowd had gathered. The boys were cheering for the short skirts. The girls were cheering for the "Onee-sama" energy.
On the court, **Rias** and **Akeno** faced off.
They weren't using magic, but they were using **Devil Stats**.

*THWACK.*
Rias served. The ball screamed across the net, breaking the sound barrier. A sonic boom rattled the fence.
**Issei:** "WOOO! GO BUCHOU!"

Akeno giggled. She moved effortlessly. She didn't swing hard; she met the ball with a fluid motion, redirecting its momentum.
*CRACK.*
The return shot carved a groove into the clay court.

**Ariel's Perspective (The Analyst):**
Ariel wasn't looking at skirts. He was in **[MND: Hyper-Focus]**.
**[Module 22: Integrated Perception]**

* **Rias (Power Style):**
* *Observation:* She plants her heel. She engages her glutes and core. She generates force from the ground up. It’s linear, explosive power.
* *Ariel:* "She fights like a cannon. One hit kill."


* **Akeno (Soft Style):**
* *Observation:* She never stops moving. She absorbs the kinetic energy of Rias's shot and adds her own spin. It’s rotational power.
* *Ariel:* "She fights like a whip. Redirection and torque."



**Issei:** "Did you see that?! The bounce!"
**Ariel:** "I know! Her torque generation is flawless! The rotational velocity on that topspin must be over 3000 RPM! It's a masterpiece of biomechanics!"

Issei stared at Ariel.
**Issei:** "Dude. You're hopeless."
**Ariel:** "I'm inspired."

### Evening: The Simulation (PTD Module 19 - Projectile Defense)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).

Ariel returned home, his mind buzzing with the image of that sonic serve.
**Ariel:** "I can't serve a ball that fast. But I need to be able to *catch* it."

**[Command: Load Data Pack - Hunter x Hunter (Greed Island)]**
**Scenario:** *Razor's Dodgeball Game.*
**Objective:** Catch the ball.

Ariel stood in the digital court. **Razor** (Simulated) stood opposite.
He threw the ball. It was a cannonball of Nen (Ki).

*Attempt 1:* Ariel tried to block.
*SMACK.*
He flew back 10 meters. **Fail.**
**Ariel:** "Too much force. I'm taking it head-on like Rias. I need to be Akeno."

*Attempt 2:* **[Module 10: Flowing Water Control]**
The ball came. Ariel coated his hands in **Armament** (to protect the skin) and **Ki** (to cushion).
He stepped back on impact, spinning his body 360 degrees to bleed off the momentum.
*Catch.*
His hands smoked. But he held the ball.

**Ariel:** "Redirection. Don't stop the force. Guide it."

He spent the evening catching lethal dodgeballs, refining the art of **"Soft Blocking."** This was the counter to Riser's heavy hits.

### Night: The Dream of the Magician (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:30 PM.

He lay in bed. His palms were stinging (phantom pain).
**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I fight **Hisoka Morrow**. I need to learn to track objects that don't move in straight lines (Bungee Gum)."

He slept, dodging playing cards in the dark.

## Day 26 (Friday): The Impossible Mission and The Tactical Retreat

### Morning: The Silent Alarm (Module 12)

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel woke up. He didn't turn off his alarm; he caught his hand *before* it hit the button.
**[Module 12: Stealth]**
**Ariel:** "Reaction time: 0.1 seconds. Silent movement: Active."

He packed his bag. Not with books, but with "Mission Gear" (Mirrors on sticks, dark clothes).
**Ariel:** "Today is the day. Operation: Aqua Vision."

### Lunch: The War Room (Social / The Heist)

**Location:** The Cafeteria.

The Perverted Quartet huddled over a blueprint of the school pool.
**Matsuda:** "The Swimming Club practices at 3:30. The windows are painted, but the ventilation shaft is open."
**Issei:** "The vents again? Last time we got stuck!"

**Ariel:** "That was due to poor noise discipline, Issei. This time, we use the **Buddy System**."
Ariel pointed to the map with a chopstick.
**Ariel:** "Issei and Matsuda are Alpha Team. You enter the vent. Motohama is Bravo (Intel). You monitor the hallway. I am Charlie (Overwatch)."

**Issei:** "You're not coming in?"
**Ariel:** "Someone needs to hold the extraction point. Besides, I need to practice my **Static Camouflage**. I will blend into the wall."
**Issei:** "You take this way too seriously, bro."
**Ariel:** "Success is 90% preparation, Issei. Do you want to see swimsuits or detention slips?"
**Issei:** "SWIMSUITS!"

### The Execution: Mission Failed (Event)

**Location:** The Indoor Pool Vents. 3:45 PM.

Ariel hung from the ceiling tiles in the hallway, holding himself up with pure **[Module 14: Core Strength]**. He was scanning for threats.
**Ariel (Comms/Whisper):** *"Alpha, status?"*
**Issei (Whisper):** *"We see light! We're almost... wait, something smells like... chocolate?"*

**Ariel:** *"Chocolate? Abort! That's the Rook!"*

Too late.
*CRASH.*
The vent cover below Issei exploded. **Koneko** stood there, holding a bag of cookies.
**Koneko:** "Perverts."

She jumped. She punched the ceiling. The ductwork groaned.
**Issei:** "RETREAT! RETREAT!"

Ariel dropped from the ceiling. He landed silently behind Koneko.
**Ariel:** "Smoke out!"
He threw a **Flour Bomb** (leftover from the church raid supply).
*POOF.*
A white cloud filled the hall.
**Koneko:** (Coughing) "Again?"

**Ariel:** "Go! Go! Go!"
He grabbed Issei and Matsuda by the collars and dragged them toward the exit, using **[Module 13: Parkour]** to vault the turnstiles.

They escaped. Barely.
They lay in the bushes outside, panting.
**Issei:** "We failed... but we lived."
**Ariel:** "Tactical withdrawal successful. No casualties. Good work, team."

### Afternoon: The Debriefing (Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:30 PM.

The team was dragged to the clubroom by Koneko (who eventually caught up).
Issei was on his knees, being scolded by Rias.
**Rias:** "Issei! Peeping on the swim team? Again?"

She looked at Ariel. He was standing at attention.
**Rias:** "And you, Ariel. I thought you were the sensible one. Why did you help them?"

**Ariel:** (Veritas / Pure Shonen) "It was a team-building exercise, President! We were testing infiltration tactics and unit cohesion under stress!"

**Rias:** "You were looking at girls."

**Ariel:** "I was looking at the *perimeter*. The girls were secondary objectives. The primary objective was stealth mastery."

Rias rubbed her temples. She looked at Akeno.
**Akeno:** "He sounds sincere, Buchou. He really treats it like a mission."
**Koneko:** "He threw flour at me. He's a nuisance." (But she was eating the cookie Ariel bought her as an apology bribe).

**Rias:** "Fine. Detention is waived. But Issei, you have extra contracts tonight."
**Issei:** "Yes, Buchou..."

### Evening: The Speed of Sound (Module 13 & 21)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.
**Location:** The Track Field (Night).

Issei went to work. Ariel stayed to train.
**Ariel:** "Koneko caught us because we were slow. I need **Soru** (Shave)."

**[Module 13: Movement] + [Module 21: Ki Reinforcement]**
He stood at the starting line.
**Theory:** Kick the ground 10 times in the blink of an eye to generate explosive propulsion.
*Ariel:* "Legs... pump."

He channeled **Golden Ki** into his ankles.
*Step.*
He exploded forward. The ground cracked slightly.
He crossed 100 meters in 9 seconds.
**Ariel:** "Fast. But not invisible. I need more torque."

He spent three hours doing sprint drills, visualizing his legs as pistons.
*Dash. Stop. Dash.*
He was learning to move in **Bursts** rather than a continuous run.

### Night: The Dream of the Blue Beast (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:30 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

He lay in bed. His quads were burning.
**[Module 20: Recovery]**
He cycled energy to his legs.

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**

Ariel woke up pumped.
**[Module 21: Inner Energy]**
He cycled his **Golden Ki**. It was vibrant today.
**Ariel:** "Today isn't about pets. It's about **Field Testing**."

He packed a blindfold in his pocket.
**Ariel:** "If the forest is full of magical creatures... it's the perfect place to test my radar against non-human signatures."

### Midday: The Expedition (Event)

**Location:** The Familiar Forest (Underworld). 12:00 PM.

The group teleported in. The air was thick with mana.
**Zatouji:** "Welcome! Find a partner! Bind them to your will!"

**Issei:** "I want a slime! For... reasons!"
**Asia:** "I want something gentle!"

**Zatouji:** (Looking at Ariel) "And you, human? What are you looking for? A wolf? A tiger?"
**Ariel:** "I'm looking for a sparring partner."

Zatouji blinked. "Excuse me?"
**Ariel:** "I'm not here to catch a pet. I'm here to grind."

### Afternoon: The Rusukaina Protocol (Module 22 - Blindfold)

**Location:** Deep Woods. 1:00 PM.

Ariel walked away from the group. He found a clearing surrounded by dense foliage.
He tied the black cloth over his eyes.
**[Module 22: Super Sensing / Observation Haki]**

**Ariel:** "Okay, nature. Come at me."

**1. The Slime (The Stealth Test)**
A slime dropped from the canopy. It made no sound.
Ariel felt the *moisture* in the air shift.
*Dodge.*
He stepped side. The slime splatted on the ground.
**Ariel:** "Too slow. I can hear you jiggle."

**2. The Sprites (The Speed Test)**
A group of lightning sprites zipped around him.
*Zip. Zap.*
They fired small shocks.
Ariel danced. He wasn't moving fast; he was moving *early*.
**Ariel:** "I feel the charge building. Left. Right. Duck."
He treated them like a batting cage machine.

**3. The Boss (The Giant Bear)**
A massive **War Bear** (B-Class Beast) stomped into the clearing. It roared.
Ariel smiled under the blindfold.
**Ariel:** "Finally. A heavy hitter."

The Bear swiped.
Ariel didn't dodge. He caught the paw.
**[Module 21: Ki Reinforcement]**
He grounded his stance. The impact shook the dirt, but Ariel didn't move.
**Ariel:** "Good force. But you telegraph your hips."

**The Spar:**
Ariel fought the bear for an hour. He didn't hurt it. He wrestled it.
He practiced **Judo Throws** on a 500kg opponent.
He practiced **Ki Deflection** against its claws.

**The Conclusion:**
The Bear panted, exhausted. It sat down, defeated.
Ariel took off the blindfold. He pulled a protein bar from his pocket and broke it in half, giving the bigger piece to the bear.
**Ariel:** "Good fight, bear-san. You have good grappling fundamentals."
The Bear ate the bar and nuzzled Ariel's hand. It respected him. Not as a Master, but as the **Alpha**.

### Evening: The Return (Social)

**Location:** The Exit Portal. 5:00 PM.

The group regrouped.

* **Issei:** Had **Ryuu** (Sprite Dragon).
* **Asia:** Had **Rassei**.
* **Ariel:** Walked out covered in dirt, scratches, and leaves, but empty-handed.

**Rias:** "Ariel? Did you fail to find a familiar?"
**Ariel:** "Nope. I found a Bear. We wrestled. He was cool."

**Zatouji:** "You... wrestled a War Bear? And you didn't capture it?"
**Ariel:** "Why would I capture him? He has his own life. We just exchanged fists. It's a warrior's bond."

**Issei:** "You are literally Goku. You just want to fight strong guys."
**Ariel:** "That's the dream, Issei."

**Rias:** (Smiling) "You truly are free-spirited, Ariel-kun."
*Rias's Thought:* *He doesn't seek ownership. He seeks challenge. That makes him dangerous, but trustworthy.*

### Evening: The Conqueror’s Seed (Module 23)

**Location:** The Park (Human World). 7:00 PM.

Ariel returned, buzzing from the workout.
**[Module 23: Will / Haki]**
The Bear had hesitated before attacking. Ariel realized why.
**Ariel:** "It wasn't just my strength. It was my **Confidence**."

He practiced projecting **Presence**.
He stared at a stray dog barking aggressively.
**Ariel's Will:** **"Sit."**
He didn't shout. He just projected the feeling of being the **Alpha**.
The dog whined and sat down.

**Ariel:** "Intimidation. If I can make a beast hesitate, I can make a Devil hesitate."

### Night: The Dream of the Beast King (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

He lay in bed.
**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I fight **Inosuke Hashibira** (*Demon Slayer*). I need to learn how to fight with animal instinct."

**The Challenge:** Connect the **Ren Mai** (Conception Vessel - Front) and **Du Mai** (Governor Vessel - Back) to create a continuous loop.
**Ariel:** "If the energy stops, I stop. If it flows, I am infinite."

He visualized the Golden Ki rising up his spine. It hit the blockage at the base of his skull (Jade Pillow).
*Pain.* Like a drill in his brain.
**Ariel:** "Push."
He used **[Module 20: Bio-Feedback]** to relax the neck muscles.
*POP.*
The energy rushed over his head, down his face, and connected at the navel.
The loop was closed. The **Microcosmic Orbit** spun.
**Effect:** Stamina regeneration increased by 200%. He was now a self-charging battery.

### Afternoon: The Full Body Flow (Module 21 - Expansion)

**Gohan:** *"You have the energy. Now, push it out. Don't fight gravity. Ignore it."*

**1. The Hover (Static Control):**
Ariel watched Goten fly effortlessly.
*Goten:* "Just do this! Whoosh!"
*Ariel:* "Not helpful, kid."

He watched Videl. She was shaking, sweating.
*Videl:* "Push... down..."
Ariel copied her. He pushed his **Golden Ki** out of his soles.
It felt like standing on a geyser.
*Lift.*
He floated 2 inches. He wobbled.
**Ariel:** "Stabilize the output. Equal pressure on both feet."

**2. The Ascent (Dynamic Control):**
**Gohan:** *"Now, lean forward. The energy goes where your mind goes."*
Ariel leaned. He didn't fall. He slid forward.
He poured more Ki into the thrusters.
*ZOOM.*
He shot up 20 meters.
**Ariel:** "I'm flying. I'm actually flying."

**3. The Landing:**
He cut the power. He fell.
At the last second, he blasted Ki to cushion the landing.
*Soft thud.*

**Ariel:** "I have the mechanics. Now I need the practice."

Ariel was flowing. He didn't just dodge; he moved *minimally*. He tilted his head 1 inch. He shifted his hip 2 inches.
**Ariel:** "Economy. Don't waste energy on a miss."

*Strike 99.*
Rayleigh fainted a swing and struck low.

The ball ricocheted and hit the thrower in the face.
*K.O.*

*Ball 2:* Three balls came at once.
Ariel activated **[Module 22: Observation]**.

He did a backflip (**Acrobatics**), letting the balls pass under him, then grabbed two mid-air.
He landed. He threw both at once.
*Double K.O.*

**Issei:** "Ariel! You're a monster!"
**Ariel:** "I'm just efficient, Issei. Aim for the feet. They can't dodge if they can't step."

### Afternoon: The Physical Exam (Event)

He gathered the Golden Ki. He compressed it (Wuxia style).
*Ha... Me...*
The ball grew dense. It whirred like a turbine.
*HAAAA!*

He thrust his hands forward.
A beam of blue/gold light erupted. It tore through the ocean surface, creating a trench of water for 50 meters.

**Ariel:** "It works. But the charge time is too long. In a fight, I'm dead."
**Roshi:** *"Then practice until you don't need to say the name."*

Ariel spent the night firing blasts until his hands smoked.

### Afternoon: The Magic Lesson (Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

**Akeno:** "Today, we learn elemental manipulation. Magic creates something from nothing using imagination."
**Issei:** "Imagination? So if I imagine fire..."
*Fwoom.* Issei made a tiny spark. "I did it!"

Ariel watched.
**Ariel:** "Magic bypasses the conservation of energy. You use mana to rewrite reality."
**Rias:** "Correct. And you, Ariel? Can you use magic?"

Ariel stood up.
**Ariel:** "No. But I can replicate the effect."

**[Module 21: Ki Projection]**
He held out his hand. He didn't imagine fire. He pushed his **Golden Ki** out and vibrated it until it generated heat.
*FWOOSH.*
A ball of golden fire appeared. It wasn't magic; it was superheated plasma created by friction.

**Akeno:** "Ara. That's... hot. But it's not magic. It's pure energy."

Ariel picked up a fallen tree branch.
**[Module 15: Weapon Mastery] + [Module 21: Ki Flow]**

**Goal:** **Imbuement (Shu / Haki Coating).**
**Ariel:** "A sword is just a sharp stick. If I pour enough energy into this stick, it becomes a sword."

He flowed his **Golden Ki** into the wood. The branch didn't rot (like Ren's); it glowed. It became reinforced, hard as steel.
*Slash.*
He cut through a thick bush. The cut was clean, as if made by a razor.
**Ariel:** "Sharpness is just a concentration of force. If I focus Ki to a micron-thin edge, anything cuts."

### Lunch: The Soul of the Sword (Event)

**Location:** The Courtyard.

Ariel sat with **Kiba Yuuto**.
**Kiba:** "Ariel-kun. I saw you practicing with that stick this morning. Your form is... unique. It looks like Kenjutsu mixed with Fencing."
**Ariel:** "It's **Hybrid Style**. I steal the best moves from every school."

**Kiba:** "I have a question. You use your fists mostly. Do you dislike weapons?"
**Ariel:** "No. I love weapons. But a weapon can break. My body regenerates. That makes me the most reliable tool in my arsenal."

**The Library Lesson (Fate/Stay Night):**
Ariel looked at Kiba. He knew Kiba's obsession with swords (Sword Birth).
**Ariel:** "But Kiba... you create swords. Have you ever thought about the *concept* of the sword?"

**Kiba:** "Concept?"

**Ariel:** "There's a Legend in my library. A man who wasn't a swordsman, but a blacksmith of his own soul. He said: *'I am the bone of my sword.'*"
Ariel tapped Kiba's chest.
**Ariel:** "Your Sacred Gear creates blades. But are they just metal? Or are they pieces of your mind? If you visualize a sword that cuts magic... or a sword that cuts distance... can you create it?"

Kiba’s eyes widened. The idea of **Conceptual Creation** rather than just **Physical Creation** struck a chord.
**Kiba:** "A sword that cuts concepts... I never thought of it that way."

**Akeno:** "Ariel-kun~ Do you think this would look good on me?"

*Ariel:* "Harder. Denser. Blacker."

He punched the tree.
*THUD.*
He didn't break the bark. He didn't hurt his hand. The impact sound was dull, like hitting a tire.
**Ariel:** "It's not fully black yet. It's 'Invisible Armor' (Level 1). But it stops the recoil."

Asia was open.

**Ariel:** "Damn it."

Ariel vaulted off the catwalk.
**[Module 20: Gravity Drop]**
He landed in front of Asia.
The slime tentacle lashed out like a whip.

**Ariel:** **[Armament Haki: Hardening]**
He crossed his arms. He poured his Will into his skin.
His forearms turned a dark, metallic grey.

*SMACK.*

The tentacle hit his arms.
It didn't stick. It didn't burn. It bounced off as if it hit a steel wall.
**Viser:** "Hard meat?"

Ariel grabbed the tentacle with his hardened hand. He squeezed.
**Ariel:** "Disgusting."
**[Module 10: Judo Throw]**
He yanked the massive Stray off balance, slamming the tentacle into the concrete floor.

Ariel didn't flinch. He didn't use Ki. He used **Will**.
**[Technique: King's Aura (Defensive)]**
He pushed back against her pressure with his own **Confidence**.
The air between them vibrated. Sona’s rook, **Tsubaki**, stepped back instinctively.

*I know Riser is coming next week. I know this peace might end. But if I keep them laughing, if I keep them hopeful... then the peace is real.*
He treated the lunch not as a goodbye, but as a promise to protect their stupidity.

### Afternoon: The King's Anxiety (Event)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

Rias was pacing. The midterms were over. Issei had passed. Contracts were going well.
But she looked pale.
**Rias:** "The wind feels... hot."

Ariel sat by the window.
**Ariel:** "Pressure front moving in?" (Metaphor).
**Rias:** "A storm. From the Phenex territory."

Ariel stood up. He walked over to her. He didn't offer pity. He offered **Confidence**.
**Ariel:** "Let it rain, President. We have umbrellas. And if the umbrella breaks, I'll punch the clouds."

Rias smiled, a weak but genuine smile.
**Rias:** "You always sound so sure, Ariel-kun."
**Ariel:** "Doubt is inefficient."

### Evening: The Calm Before (Free Time)

**Location:** The Park.

Ariel sat on the swing. He watched the sunset.
**Ariel:** "Monday. He arrives Monday." (In this timeline, Riser arrives earlier or the feeling is preemptive).

He clenched his fist. The **Conqueror's Haki** hummed under his skin.
**Ariel:** "I'm not going to let him burn this town. I'm not going to let him touch Issei."

He was the **Shield**. And the Shield was ready.

### Night: The Dream of the Dragon (Module 9)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.

**[Module 9: Lucid Dream]**
**Ariel:** "Tonight... I fight **Issei** (Future Version / DxD). I need to know if I can stand next to a Dragon God."

## Day 42 (Sunday): The Game, The Feast, and The Calm

### Morning: The Silent Maintenance (Module 1, 7, 8)

**Time:** 8:00 AM.
**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.

Ariel slept in. He woke up feeling refreshed.
**[Module 7: Awareness]**
His body was at 100%. No soreness. No fatigue. His energy circuits were humming perfectly.
**[Module 8: Meditation]**
He sat for an hour. He visualized a lake. Still water.
*Ariel:* "A warrior needs rest. Tension breaks the blade."

### Midday: The Video Game Tournament (Event)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence. 12:00 PM.

Issei invited Ariel over.
**Issei:** "Training is banned today! Today is for *Smash Bros*!"
**Asia:** "I will cheer for everyone!"

**The Teams:**

* **Issei:** Played with passion. Mashed buttons. Screamed when he died.
* **Ariel:** Played with **[Module 5: Frame Data Analysis]**. He picked the "Low Tier" character and won by exploiting spacing.

**Ariel:** "Issei, you're predictable. You always go for the smash attack."
**Issei:** "But it's powerful!"
**Ariel:** "It has a 2-second recovery frame. I punish it every time."
**Issei:** "Stop applying martial arts to video games!"

They laughed. For three hours, there were no Devils. No Fallen Angels. Just two friends arguing about pixels.
*Ariel's Thought:* *I'll fight Riser just to keep this kid laughing.*

### Evening: The Harem Dinner (Event)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.

Rias and Akeno arrived with groceries.
**Rias:** "We are making a feast. To celebrate Issei passing his midterms."
**Akeno:** "And to fatten him up before... well, before next week."

**The Atmosphere:**
It was warm. Issei's parents were fawning over Rias. Asia was happy.
Ariel sat at the end of the table. He wasn't isolated; he was the **Anchor**.
When Issei panicked about Akeno feeding him, Ariel passed him a napkin.
When Rias looked sad for a moment (thinking of the engagement), Ariel poured her tea.
**Ariel:** "It's a good night, President."
**Rias:** (Smiling) "It is. Thank you, Ariel."

### Night: The Final Calm (Free Time)

**Time:** 9:00 PM.
**Location:** The Walk Home.

Ariel walked home under the streetlights. The air was cool.
He felt the shift in the atmosphere. The pressure he had sensed for days was coalescing.
**[Module 22: Observation]**
He looked toward the sky.
*Ariel:* "Tomorrow. The Silver Queen arrives tomorrow."

He went to bed.
**Ariel:** "No Lucid Dream tonight. Just sleep. I need every ounce of focus."

## Day 43 (Monday): The Silver Queen and The Iron Shield

### Morning: The Silent Alarm (Module 7 & 22)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
Ariel woke up. He didn't need an alarm. His **Observation Haki** pinged him.
A massive, cold energy source had entered the town.
**Ariel:** "She's here."

He walked to school. The air felt static, like before a thunderstorm.
**[Module 22: Void Sense]**
He tracked the energy signature. It was stationary near the Hyoudou Residence.
*Ariel:* "She's observing Issei. Assessing the Pawn."

### School: The Daydream (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was distracted.
**Issei:** "Ariel... I feel like someone is watching me. Not like Rias. Like... a judge."
**Ariel:** "Trust your gut, Issei. Your instincts are sharpening."

### Afternoon: The Messenger (Event - Grayfia)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

Rias gathered the Peerage. The atmosphere was heavy.
A silver magic circle appeared. **Grayfia Lucifuge** stepped out.
The room froze.
**Issei:** "Who... who is that? She's terrifying."
**Rias:** "Grayfia. My brother's Queen."

**Grayfia:** "Lady Rias. Lord Sirzechs inquires why you have not returned home."
**Rias:** "I am not marrying him."
**Grayfia:** "Your feelings are irrelevant. Lord Riser arrives tomorrow."

**The Interaction (Ariel):**
Grayfia turned her gaze to Ariel. She scanned the room, cataloging threats.
*Issei (Boosted Gear):* Threat.
*Kiba/Koneko/Akeno:* Known quantities.
*Ariel:* **Unknown.**

**Grayfia:** "And you. The human."
The pressure in the room spiked. A wave of **Demonic Aura** washed over them. Issei buckled. Asia hid behind Koneko.

Ariel didn't flinch. He stood perfectly still, his posture relaxed but rooted.
**[Module 23: King's Aura (Defensive)]**
He pushed back with his own **Will**. He created a bubble of "Normalcy" around himself.
The demonic pressure hit his aura and slid off.

**Grayfia:** (Narrowing eyes) "You resisted my pressure. Without magic."
**Ariel:** "I have good posture, Ma'am."
**Grayfia:** "Intriguing. Rias, your pet is... unique. Ensure he does not get burned tomorrow."

She vanished.
**Rias:** "Ariel... you stood up to her."
**Ariel:** "She was testing us. If we flinched, she would have dismissed us. Now, she's curious."

### Evening: The Family Dinner (Event - Issei)

**Location:** Hyoudou Residence.

Grayfia stayed at Issei's house (disguised as a maid/relative).
Issei texted Ariel: *"HELP! She's eating dinner with us! She criticized my chopstick holding!"*

Ariel texted back: *"Listen to her. She is the strongest Queen in the Underworld. If she tells you how to hold a stick, you hold it that way."*

### Night: The Final Calibration (Module 5 & 20)

**Time:** 10:00 PM.
**Location:** Ariel's Apartment.

Ariel sat in the dark.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow is Riser. He uses Fire. He uses Regeneration."
**[Module 5: Image Training]**
He visualized Riser.
*Ariel:* "Fire has no mass. I can't block it with muscle. I have to block it with **Haki**."

He practiced **[Module 20: Ki Coating]**.
He covered his fists in Golden Ki.
**Ariel:** "Tomorrow... I punch the sun."

He slept, ready for the main event.

---

### 📊 Day 43 Stats:

* **PHY:** 4.8 (Maintained).
* **MND:** 10.0 (Tactical analysis of Grayfia).
* **WIL:** 7.9 (Resisted Ultimate-Class pressure).

## Day 44 (Tuesday): The Fire, The Fist, and The Shonen Roar

### Morning: The Silent Engine (Module 7 & 21)

**Time:** 6:00 AM.
Ariel woke up. He felt the shift in the ley lines.
**[Module 21: Inner Energy]**
He didn't cycle his Ki gently. He revved it up.
*Ariel:* "Engine hot. Systems green."
He walked to school radiating a faint, invisible heat. He was a loaded gun.

### School: The Daydreamer (Social)

**Location:** Class 2-B.

Issei was shaking. Grayfia had terrified him.
**Issei:** "She's so strong, Ariel. How do we fight people like that?"
**Ariel:** "We don't fight them on their terms, Issei. We change the game."
**Issei:** "Change the game?"
**Ariel:** "If they use Magic, we use Guts. If they use Authority, we use Defiance."

### Afternoon: The Fire (Event - Riser's Arrival)

**Location:** Occult Research Clubroom. 4:00 PM.

The circle appeared. **Riser Phenex** stepped out.
The room temperature spiked. Riser sneered at the "shack."
Riser grabbed **Yubelluna**. He kissed her. He groped her.

**Issei:** "THAT'S NOT A HAREM! THAT'S SLAVERY!"
**[BOOST!]**
Issei charged. Riser’s Rook (**Mira**) intercepted.
*CRACK.*
Issei hit the wall.

**Riser:** "Burn, trash."
Riser threw the fireball at Issei.

**Ariel's Action:**
In Route B, Ren watched.
In Route A, Ariel moved.

**[Module 13: Burst Speed]**
Ariel vanished. He appeared in front of Issei.
**Ariel:** "Not today."

**[Technique: Conqueror's Coating + Iron Body]**
He didn't dodge. He planted his feet. He coated his right fist in **Black Haki** (invisible to them, but felt as pressure) and **Golden Ki**.

*Riser's Fireball* vs. *Ariel's Fist.*

**Ariel:** "**SMASH!**"

*BOOM.*

He punched the fireball.
Physics broke. The fire didn't explode around him; it was **shattered**. The shockwave of his punch blew the flames backward, extinguishing them instantly.
Ariel stood there. His sleeve was burned off. His knuckles were smoking. But his skin was unbroken.

**Riser:** "You... you punched fire?"

Ariel shook his hand out. He grinned—a wild, fearless, Shonen grin.
**Ariel:** "Fire is just energy, Riser! And my Will is denser than your heat!"

He pointed at Riser.
**Ariel:** "You hurt my friend. You insulted the President. And you ruined the mood. We challenge you! **Rating Game!** Winner takes all!"

**Issei:** (Struggling up) "Yeah! What he said! We'll crush you!"

**Riser:** (Furious) "You... arrogant monkeys! Fine! I accept! Ten days! Prepare to turn to ash!"
He vanished.

### Evening: The Camp Decision (Event)

**Location:** Clubroom. 6:00 PM.

The room cooled down. Rias looked at Ariel.
**Rias:** "Ariel. You... blocked a Phenex fireball."
**Ariel:** "I punched it, President. Blocking is passive. Punching is active."

**Rias:** "We are going to the mountains. Ten days."
She looked at him. She didn't offer him a "Cook" position. She offered him a **Role**.

**Rias:** "We need to get stronger. Fast. Issei needs to learn how to use his power. Kiba needs speed. Koneko needs flow."
She bowed her head slightly.
**Rias:** "Will you help us? Will you show us how a human defies a God?"

Ariel smiled. He gave a thumbs up.
**Ariel:** "**Veritas Dojo** goes mobile! Pack your bags, everyone! We're going on a Training Arc!"

**Issei:** "YEAH! TRAINING ARC!"

### Night: The Preparation (Module 5 & 20)

**Location:** Ariel's Apartment. 10:00 PM.

Ariel packed his gear.
**Ariel:** "Ten days. I need to turn Issei into a weapon."

**[Module 5: Image Training]**
He planned the curriculum.

* *Issei:* Focus Training (Stone drill).
* *Kiba:* Blindfold Training (Observation).
* *Koneko:* Redirection (Tai Chi).

**Ariel:** "This is it. The real game starts now."

---

### 📊 Day 44 Stats:

* **PHY:** 5.0 (Defensive capability proven).
* **MND:** 10.0 (Tactical leadership accepted).
* **SPR:** 5.0 (Haki Coating combat-tested).
* **Status:** **The Sensei.** Ariel is now the de facto combat instructor for the Peerage.

## Day 44 (Tuesday): The Fire, The Fist, and The Shonen Roar

### Late Afternoon: The Engagement (Event - Part 1)

**Time:** 4:00 PM.
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

The silver magic circle glowed. **Grayfia Lucifuge** stepped out.
**Grayfia:** "Lady Rias. Lord Sirzechs insists."
**Rias:** "I refuse to marry him, Grayfia. He is..."

*WOOSH.*
A pillar of orange flame erupted in the center of the room. The heat was instantaneous. Books curled on the shelves.
**Riser Phenex** stepped out of the fire, wearing a white suit, looking bored. Behind him, fifteen women materialized.

**Riser:** "Rias. Stop being difficult. It's time to go."
He looked around.
**Riser:** "This place smells of dust. Is this where you keep your pets?"

**Issei:** "Hey! Don't talk about Buchou like that!"

**Riser:** (Sneering) "A Pawn? Speaking to a Pure-Blood? Know your place."
He walked past Issei, ignoring him. He walked to Rias.
**Riser:** "You are playing a game, Rias. But the game is over. You belong to the Phenex."

**Issei:** "She doesn't belong to anyone! I'm going to be the Harem King, and I treat girls with respect!"

**Riser:** (Stopping) "Harem King? You?"
He laughed.
**Riser:** "Yubelluna."
His Queen stepped forward. Riser grabbed her, kissed her deeply, and groped her chest while staring at Issei.
**Riser:** "This is a Harem. Ownership. Submission. Do you understand now, trash?"

### The Escalation (Event - Part 2)

**Issei:** "THAT'S NOT A HAREM! THAT'S SLAVERY!"
**[BOOST!]**
Issei charged.

**Riser:** "Mira."
Riser’s Rook, a tall woman with a staff, stepped in. She swung the staff with casual strength.
*CRACK.*
Issei took the hit to the ribs. He flew back, crashing into the sofa.

**Kiba:** "Issei-kun!" (Draws sword).
**Karlamine (Riser's Knight):** (Draws sword) "Stay back, Gremory Knight."
The room was a powder keg.

**Riser:** "Annoying."
Riser looked at Issei, who was struggling to stand up.
**Riser:** "You have Spirit. But Spirit burns."

Riser raised his hand. A sphere of compressed **Hellfire** formed.
**Riser:** "Burn."

### The Intervention (Ariel's Moment)

**Canon Deviation:** In canon, Grayfia stops this. Here, Ariel stops it *first*.

Ariel was standing by the window. He had been quiet, observing.
**Ariel:** "He's going to kill him. Rias is too far. Grayfia is waiting to see what happens."

**[Module 13: Burst Speed]**
Ariel moved. He didn't use magic. He used explosive leg power.
He crossed the room in 0.2 seconds.
He stepped in front of Issei.

**Riser:** "Die."
He threw the fireball.

**Ariel:** **[Armament Haki + Ki Reinforcement]**
Ariel didn't block. He punched.
He drove his right fist directly into the center of the fireball.
**Ariel:** "**SMASH!**"

*BOOM.*

The impact created a shockwave that shattered the windows.
The fireball didn't explode outward; it was **dispersed**. The force of Ariel's punch scattered the flames before they could detonate.
Ariel stood there. His sleeve was gone. His arm was smoking. But he was grinning.

**Riser:** "What?!"

Ariel shook his hand.
**Ariel:** "That was hot. But it wasn't heavy."

He pointed at Riser.
**Ariel:** "You bully a Pawn because he's weak? That's not Noble. That's pathetic. Fight someone who hits back!"

**Grayfia:** (Stepping in) "Enough."
Her voice froze the room. The fires died.
**Grayfia:** "Lord Riser. Attacking a civilian is a violation."
She looked at Ariel.
**Grayfia:** "And you. You stopped a High-Class magic attack with... physical force?"

**Ariel:** "I exercised this morning."

**Grayfia:** "The situation is volatile. Lord Sirzechs proposes a **Rating Game**. If Rias wins, the engagement is void."

**Riser:** "A game? Against *them*? And him?" (Points to Ariel).
**Rias:** "Yes. All of us."

**Riser:** "Fine. Ten days. I will crush you all."
He vanished in fire.

### Evening: The Camp Decision (The Sensei)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Location:** Clubroom.

The room was quiet. Issei was healed by Asia.
**Rias:** "Ariel. You saved him."
**Ariel:** "He needed a spotter."

**Rias:** "We have ten days. We are going to the mountains."
She looked at Ariel.
**Rias:** "I cannot ask you to fight in the Game. You are human. But... you clearly know how to fight."

**Issei:** "Buchou! Let him train us! Did you see that punch?! He punched *fire*!"
**Kiba:** "I agree. His technique is... unlike anything we know."
**Koneko:** "He's strong."

Rias nodded.
**Rias:** "Ariel Veritas. Will you join us at the camp? Not as a servant. As a **Trainer**."

Ariel smiled. He gave a thumbs up.
**Ariel:** "**Veritas Dojo** goes mobile! Pack your bags, everyone! We're going on a Training Arc! Issei, bring protein powder!"

**Issei:** "YEAH! TRAINING ARC!"

## Day 44 (Tuesday): The Fire, The Ban, and The VIP

### [Previous Scene: Ariel punches the Fireball. Riser is shocked.]

**Grayfia:** "Enough."

The silver aura of the Ultimate Queen flooded the room, suppressing Riser’s flames instantly.
**Grayfia:** "Lord Riser. Attacking a civilian is a violation of the treaty."

She turned her gaze to Ariel. She wasn't surprised by his feat. She looked like she had just confirmed a hypothesis.
**Grayfia:** "And you, Ariel Caelum Veritas. Our intelligence division has been monitoring the energy fluctuations around this town. We suspected an external factor. Your action just confirmed it."

**Ariel:** "I'm just a gym rat, Grayfia-san."

**Grayfia:** "You are a **Factor**. A human capable of nullifying High-Class magic with physical force disrupts the balance of the Rating Game."

**Grayfia:** "Lord Sirzechs proposes a Rating Game to settle this engagement. However..."

She raised a hand, creating a barrier between Ariel and the Devils.

**Grayfia:** "**Ariel Veritas is banned from participation.** You may not fight. You may not enter the game field. You may not serve as a Tactician via communication magic. Rias Gremory must prove *her* strength, not yours."

**Issei:** "What?! That's not fair! He's our friend!"
**Rias:** "Issei, quiet. Grayfia is right. If Ariel fights, the rating is invalid."

**Ariel:** (Shrugging) "Makes sense. I'm not a Devil. It's not my war."

**Grayfia:** "However..."
Her expression softened ever so slightly—a message from the Maou himself.
**Grayfia:** "Lord Sirzechs is quite interested in the human who defies logic. He extends a personal invitation. You will sit beside him in the **VIP Observation Room** during the game. He wishes to hear your commentary."

Ariel paused. To sit beside the Devil King? That was the best seat in the house.
**Ariel:** "I accept. I'll bring the popcorn."

**Riser:** "Hmph. Watch closely, monkey. Watch me burn your friends."
Riser vanished in a pillar of fire.

### Evening: The Camp Decision (The Sensei)

**Time:** 6:00 PM.
**Location:** Clubroom.

The room was quiet. The weight of the ban hung over them.
**Rias:** "So... you cannot fight with us. And you cannot command us."

**Ariel:** "No. When the game starts, you are on your own."
He looked at Issei, Kiba, and Koneko.
**Ariel:** "That means we have 10 days to make sure you don't *need* me."

He slammed his hand on the table.
**Ariel:** "I'm not coming as a Strategist. I'm coming as a **Drill Sergeant**. I'm going to break you down and build you back up so strong that Riser won't know what hit him. **Veritas Dojo** goes mobile!"

**Issei:** "You're gonna kill us, aren't you?"
**Ariel:** "Only a little bit. Pack your bags."

### 📊 Day 44 Stats:

* **PHY:** 5.0 (Combat Proven).
* **MND:** 10.0 (Status recognized by Lucifer).
* **Status:** **Banned.** Role shifted from "Player" to "Coach."

## Day 45 (Wednesday): The Sergeant and The Mountain

### Morning: The Exodus (Module 3)

**Time:** 7:00 AM.
**Location:** Old School Building.

The group loaded the van. Ariel wore a whistle around his neck and a clipboard.
**Ariel:** "Issei! Move those boxes! Engage the glutes!"
**Issei:** "We haven't even left yet!"

### Midday: The Arrival (Camp Setup)

**Location:** Gremory Villa.

**Ariel:** "Alright, listen up! Rias is the King, but for the next 10 days, this is my Dojo. Rule 1: No Magic unless specified. We are building the engine, not the paint job."

**The Drill:**
Ariel pointed to the mountain peak.
**Ariel:** "Issei. Run up that mountain. Carry two tires."
**Issei:** "Two?!"
**Ariel:** "Kiba. Run up the mountain. But you have to dodge every tree branch without cutting them. **Observation Training.**"
**Koneko:** "And me?"
**Ariel:** "Run up the mountain. Carrying Kiba's supplies. **Endurance.**"

They ran. Ariel ran *with* them, carrying four tires just to prove a point.
**Ariel:** "Keep up! The weak get left behind!"

### Afternoon: The Healer's Defense (Asia)

**Time:** 3:00 PM.
**Location:** The Villa Garden.

Asia was left behind.
**Asia:** "Ariel-san... I am not a fighter. What should I do?"
**Ariel:** "In the game, Riser will target the healer first. You need to survive for 10 seconds until help arrives."

**[Module 16: Self-Defense / Evasion]**
Ariel taught her **Footwork**.
**Ariel:** "Don't run away. Run *around*. Keep an obstacle between you and the enemy."
He chased her around a tree.
*Asia:* "Eep!"
*Ariel:* "Faster! If I tag you, you're dead!"

He taught her **Ki-Assisted Healing**.
**Ariel:** "Don't just pour magic. Target the wound. Visualize the cells knitting together. Efficiency saves mana."

### Evening: The Dragon's Focus (Issei)

**Time:** 7:00 PM.

Issei collapsed on the grass.
**Issei:** "I... can't... move..."
**Ariel:** "Good. Your muscles are broken. Now we train the Mind."

Ariel handed Issei a stone.
**Ariel:** "Hold this. Pour your desire into it. But don't let it explode. Keep it inside the stone."
**Issei:** "Like... charging a battery?"
**Ariel:** "Like holding your breath underwater. The longer you hold it, the bigger the burst when you let go."

Issei focused. The stone glowed red. It flickered.
**Ariel:** "Steady. Riser is laughing at you. Don't let him win."
The glow stabilized.

### Night: The Private Grind (Module 20 & 22)

**Time:** 11:00 PM.

The Peerage slept. Ariel went to the roof.
**Ariel:** "I can't fight in the game. But I need to be ready if Riser breaks the rules again."

**[Module 22: Observation Haki (Advanced)]**
He expanded his senses to cover the entire mountain.
*Ariel:* "I need to see everything. Every leaf. Every bird."
He was building a **Radar** that could detect cheating from miles away.

---

### 📊 Day 45 Stats:

* **PHY:** 5.1 (Mountain training benefit).
* **MND:** 10.0 (Instructor Mode).
* **Status:** Camp Day 1 Complete. The Peerage is exhausted but motivated.

## Phase 1: The Mountain Dojo (Days 46-54)

**The Camp Summary:**
Ariel transformed the Gremory Villa into a boot camp. He didn't use magic; he used **Physics** and **Philosophy**.

### The Breakthroughs:

1. **Kiba (The Speed of Sound):**
* *Problem:* Kiba was fast but wasted energy on flashy movements.
* *The Lesson:* Ariel sparred with him blindfolded. "I can hit you because you scream with your body before you swing. **Economy of Motion.** Only move the muscle needed for the kill."
* *Result:* Kiba learned to move in straight lines with zero telegraphing.


2. **Koneko (The Unmovable Object):**
* *Problem:* She tanked hits with raw defense, taking damage.
* *The Lesson:* Ariel taught her **Flow (Tai Chi principle)**. "Don't stop the train; switch the tracks."
* *Result:* She learned to redirect kinetic energy, throwing larger opponents using their own mass.


3. **Issei (The Engine):**
* *Problem:* Could not maintain the Boosted Gear.
* *The Lesson:* **Focus.** Ariel made Issei hold a heavy stone while maintaining the Gear. "Desire isn't an explosion; it's a fuel source. Burn steady."
* *Result:* Issei unlocked the **10-Second Burst** stability.



**The End of Camp:**
They took the group photo. Ariel stood in the center, arms crossed, grinning. He wasn't a blur in the background; he was the **Pillar** holding them up.

---

## Phase 2: The VIP Box (Day 56 - The Rating Game)

**Location:** The Observation Room.
**Role:** The Commentator.

Ariel sat next to **Sirzechs Lucifer**.
**Sirzechs:** "You trained them. Let's see if your 'Human Science' works against Immortal Magic."

**The Game:**
It wasn't a slaughter. It was a **Dissection**.

* **Koneko** didn't get overwhelmed; she redirected the Rook's punches into the walls.
* **Kiba** didn't tire out; he sniped the Knight and retreated.
* **Issei** didn't panic; he used the tactics Ariel drilled into him.

**The Climax:**
Issei vs. Riser.
Issei was losing on power, but winning on **Heart**. He used the Holy Water. He used the Dragon Shot.
**Ariel:** (Whispering) "Target the regeneration core. Don't stop hitting."
Issei landed the final blow.
**Winner:** Hyoudou Issei.

**Sirzechs:** "Impressive. You turned a mob into an army in ten days."
**Ariel:** "I just gave them a manual. They did the reading."

---

## Phase 3: The Sore Loser (Day 57 - The Riser Incident)

**Location:** The Clubroom.
**The Twist:** Riser returns, furious. He activates **The Cage of Embers**—an artifact that seals Demonic Power in the room.

**The Crisis:**
Rias, Akeno, Kiba, Koneko—all paralyzed. Issei is unconscious on the couch.
Riser stands over Issei with a blade of fire.
**Riser:** "No magic. No rescue. I kill the Pawn, I void the game."

**The Variable:**
Ariel stood up. The seal ignored him. He had no Demonic Power to suppress.
**Ariel:** "You really are a sore loser."

**The Fight (Ariel vs. Riser):**

* **Riser:** "Die, human!" (Throws Fire).
* **Ariel:** **[Armament Haki + Iron Body]**. He slapped the fire aside.
* **Riser:** "Why won't you burn?!"
* **Ariel:** "Because I decided not to."

Ariel engaged in **CQC**. He broke Riser's arm. He swept his legs. He mounted him.
**[Nullification Intent]**
Ariel punched Riser's face.

* **Riser:** "Regenerate! Regenerate!"
* **Ariel:** **"NO."**
Ariel's Will overpowered Riser's magic. The healing stopped. Riser felt true pain.

**Sirzechs Intervenes:**
Sirzechs stopped Ariel before he killed Riser.
**Rias:** (Staring in horror/awe) "He... he turned off the immortality."
Ariel stood up, wiping blood from his lip.
**Ariel:** "He broke the rules. I enforced them."

---

## Phase 4: The Departure (Day 63 - The Wedding Crash)

**Context:** Rias is taken to the Underworld for formalities (or just to wrap up). The "Wedding" is cancelled, but the celebration of the *Cancellation* happens.

**The Event:**
Issei and the peerage go to the Underworld as heroes.
Ariel stays behind.
He realizes he has hit the **Absolute Limit**.

* He beat Riser, but he broke his hand doing it.
* He blocked the fire, but his skin burned.
* He sees **Sirzechs** and **Grayfia**. He realizes they are galaxies ahead of him.

**The Decision:**
**Ariel:** "I can't get stronger here. The physics of this world are too soft. I need higher gravity. I need denser mana."

He accesses the **PTD**. He finds the **Corridor of Darkness** function (unlocked by the clash of wills).
**Ariel:** "The Path to the Multiverse."

## Phase 5: The Finale (Day 64 - The Veritas Revelation)

**Location:** The Clubroom. Victory Party.

Ariel gathered the Peerage.
**Ariel:** "I'm leaving."
**Issei:** "What?! Why? We're the strongest team now!"

**Ariel:** "You are the strongest *Devil* team. I am a human hitting a glass ceiling."

**The Revelation:**
He showed them the **Library of Legends**.

* **Garp** punching mountains.
* **Beerus** erasing planets.
* **Dokgo Ryong** destroying landscapes.

**Ariel:** "I don't want to be the 'Strongest Human.' I want to be able to spar with *them*. And I can't do that here."

**The Legacy:**
He handed them the **Training Manuals** (The USB).

* To Issei: **The Path of the Dragon God.**
* To Kiba: **The Path of the Sword Saint.**
* To Koneko: **The Path of the Vajra.**

**The Exit:**
He opened the Corridor. Unlike Ren's violet void, Ariel's rift shimmered with **Golden Light** (reflecting his Ki/Haki alignment).
**Rias:** "Will you return?"
**Ariel:** "When I can punch a star, President. I'll be back for the rematch."

He fist-bumped Issei.
**Ariel:** "Keep grinding."
**Issei:** "You too, bro."

Ariel stepped into the light. He went to find the worlds where the gravity was 100x Earth's, ready to become a God.

## Phase 4: The Business Trip (Day 63)

**Context:** The dust has settled. Riser has been sent back to the Underworld in a body cast. The Gremory Peerage is safe.

**Location:** Ariel’s Apartment.
**Time:** Evening.

Ariel looked at his hand. The burns from Riser's fire were fully healed thanks to his advanced **Bio-Feedback**, but the memory of the heat remained.
**Ariel:** "I blocked it. But I felt the limit. If Riser had been stronger—if he were Sirzechs—I would be ash."

He accessed the **PTD**.
**[System Alert: New Map Available. The Corridor of Darkness.]**
Ariel grinned.
**Ariel:** "A dimensional shortcut. High gravity. Dense mana. It’s the ultimate gym."

He began to pack. Not a "Goodybe" bag, but a "Gym" bag.

* Protein bars.
* Spare clothes.
* First Aid kit.
* A notebook for recording new techniques.

**Ariel:** "I'm not running away. I'm just going out to buy milk. The milk of absolute power."

## Phase 5: The Finale (Day 64 - The Veritas Revelation)

**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom. Victory Party.

### 1. The Announcement

The party was in full swing. Issei was bragging about his Dragon Shot.
Ariel tapped his glass with a spoon.
**Ariel:** "Attention, everyone. I have an announcement."

The room quieted.
**Ariel:** "I'm taking a leave of absence from school. Probably a few weeks. Maybe a month. Depends on the time dilation."

**Rias:** "A leave? Where are you going, Ariel-kun? The Underworld?"
**Ariel:** "Further. I'm going on a **Business Trip**."

**Issei:** "Business? What business?"
**Ariel:** "The business of getting strong enough to punch a hole in the moon."

### 2. The Library of Legends (The Syllabus)

Ariel activated the **PTD Projection**.
He showed them the **Library**.

* **Beerus** yawning while destroying a planet.
* **Saitama** missing a sale at the supermarket.
* **Garp** laughing while throwing cannonballs.

**Ariel:** "These are my coaches. They live in other frequencies of reality. I'm going to go pay them a visit."

**Kiba:** "You can... travel to other dimensions?"
**Ariel:** "The PTD found a door. It’s called the **Corridor**. It’s a bit rough, but it gets you there."

### 3. The "See You Later"

Rias stood up. She looked concerned.
**Rias:** "Ariel. Dimensional travel is dangerous. You are human."

Ariel walked over to her. He put a hand on her shoulder—a gesture of equal footing.
**Ariel:** "President. Don't worry. I'm not quitting the club. I'm just taking a sabbatical. Think of me as an **External Consultant**."

He looked at Issei.
**Ariel:** "Issei. While I'm gone, you're the Shield. Don't slack off on the meditation. If I come back and you can't hold the Boost for 20 seconds, I'm doubling your gravity training."

**Issei:** (Saluting) "Yes, Sensei! Bring me back a souvenir!"
**Ariel:** "I'll bring you a cool rock. Or a laser sword. Whatever I find."

### 4. The Departure

Ariel walked to the center of the room.
He slashed the air. The **Golden Rift** opened. Unlike Ren's scary void, Ariel's portal felt like a warm breeze—an adventure waiting to happen.

**Koneko:** "Come back safe."
**Ariel:** "I'm too stubborn to die, Koneko-chan."

He stepped onto the threshold. He turned back and grinned.
**Ariel:** "I'll be back for the School Festival. Try not to start a war without me."

He stepped through.
The portal closed with a *zing* sound.

**Rias:** (Sighing with a smile) "He really treats the multiverse like a convenience store."
**Akeno:** "Ara ara. That's our Ariel-kun."
