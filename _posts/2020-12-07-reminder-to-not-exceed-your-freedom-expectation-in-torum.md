In this article, I will talk about the [terms of services](https://www.torum.com/terms) section which is probably mostly ignored by users where in my observation is due to the text size, color, no emphasizing, and its location. It maybe fine for new users to ignore this for a while, but sooner or later this section is something that we must read. The two reasons are to avoid problems in the long run and to not over expect about Torum.

Torum is a unique social media platform even among crypto platforms. Torum is fun to use because of its [various missions](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fajar.purnama/various-missions-makes-torum-crypto-social-media-fun?r=fajar.purnama) and [other gamifications](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fajar.purnama/torum-towards-gamifying-the-crypto-social-media-ecosystem?r=fajar.purnama). Unfortunately, it is not a censorship resistant platform which means that you cannot totally post anything you want. The good news is that Torum only intends to censor obvious negative contents such as violence. This means they do not intend to censor contents that does not sound good for the governments such as [London Reals repeated suspension due to journalism about COVID-19](https://reclaimthenet.org/london-real-banned-linkedin/) and [the mass Youtube crypto purge in new year 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/12/26/googles-youtube-goes-to-war-with-bitcoin-and-crypto-update/?sh=31319f791b63). The bad news is Torum is a transparent company where [even the headquarters are known](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@fajar.purnama/the-team-and-headquarter-and-who-to-follow-on-torum?r=fajar.purnama). Although they only want to censor obvious negative contents, the government and authorities can pressure them to take down contents that they do not approve. If you think that this bad news does not affect the general crypto community then think again. Torum is design for crypto startups to come and interract with the community and what happens if they decide to launch [an intial coin offering (ICO) or initial exchange offering (IEO) that has not been approved by The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/in-crackdown-of-crypto-sec-goes-after-unregistered-coin-offerings.html)? [Like Binance, the regulators can ask Torum to take down the ICOs, IEOs, etc, or exclude United States (US) citizens or face legal actions](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84020/binance-blocking-us-users-exchange-email-2).

## Should Torum head for decentralization?

Which crypto projects does not want to have a decentralized platform? Surely it is the best interest for Torum in the long run. However, the approach is the problem. If the current Torum shifts to decentralized platform and the team shifts to decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), it may have to sacrifice some current users and future users because the approach will lessen the chance for the application to be listed in well known stores now such as [Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/) and [App Store](https://www.apple.com/en/app-store/). Even among crypto users, few still uses decentralized applications (dapps) and open source stores such as [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). [LBRY was once delisted from playstore due to some contents](https://twitter.com/LBRYcom/status/1309499253279129600), [Bittube.tv was once suspended by Google](https://twitter.com/BitTubeApp/status/1301275715829202945), and [Fortnite was suspended in appstore and playstore for installing direct payment](https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/09/epic-loses-court-bid-to-force-apple-to-bring-fortnite-back-to-app-store). The best approach that I know is to make two different platform where one is centralized and the other one is decentralized and ofcourse the limitation is the resource where I understand if it is too much for the team to handle.
