## [1\. Most of My Previous Advices](https://0darkking0.blogspot.com/2019/09/my-inspiration-for-global-financial.html)

*   Currencies in your banks will be gone.
*   Food, Water, Shelter.
*   Knowledge, experience, strength, ability, networking.
*   Gold and other precious metals.
*   Properties, real estates, and land.
*   Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
*   Stocks.
*   Business and other assets.
*   Fiat.
*   Certificate of deposit, bonds, mutual funds, and stakes.

Will be too late. Maybe you still have a chance to exchange your fiat as fast as possible, but most likely no one wants them anymore.

## 2\. <strike>Current Way</strike> Advice: return to old way or find new way.


*   Overall, increase your knowledge, experience, strength, ability, networking.
*   Get help: The more people you know the better so increase your network but close or trusted friends are far better.
*   Return to nature: learn how to harvest food from plants, find clean water, hunt for food, fishing, dig for insects, build tree houses, farming, etc.
*   Self defense: learn martial arts, fighting, increase your physics, agility, flexibility, etc because security no longer functions when the system is down.
*   Return to barter: currency is useless now, trade items and services.
*   Be a child again and start your adventure or start exploring.
*   Learn cultivation, meditation, relaxation, sit near trees, etc.
*   Pray.
