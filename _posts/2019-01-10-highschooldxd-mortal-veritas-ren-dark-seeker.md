# 🌑 Chapter 1: The Tactician of Trash and the Wall of Physics

![Chapter 1 Cover](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1-cover.jpg)

Timeline: Spring. Start of 2nd Year.
Location: Kuoh Academy. 

## 1.1 The Mission Briefing (The Pervert Phase)

![Peeping Strategy](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.1-peeping-strategy.jpg)

The sun beat down on the Old Gymnasium. Four figures crouched in the bushes, dressed in Kuoh Academy uniforms. Issei Hyoudou. Matsuda. Motohama.
And Ren Nocturnus Veritas. Ren held a rolled-up architectural blueprint of the gym. He wore glasses (which he didn't actually need, but he wore them to look like a Strategist). He looked serious, like he was planning a bank heist.

Ren: "Gentlemen. Target is the Kendo Club changing room. The window is located at Vector Alpha-Nine. However, the Student Council patrol passed by three minutes ago. We have a five-minute window."

Issei: "Ren! You're a genius! You memorized the patrol routes?!"

Ren: "Of course. Information is ammunition, Issei. If we want to see the 'Legendary Hills' of the Vice-Captain, we must be ghosts."

Ren was having the time of his life. He loved this. The camaraderie. The thrill. The dream that maybe, if he played his cards right, he’d get a girlfriend. He was a pervert, yes, but he was an Honest Pervert. He didn't hide his desires; he strategized for them.

Ren: "Matsuda, Motohama, create a diversion at the West Gate. Issei, you're with me. We take the high ground."

## 1.2 The Encounter (The First Defeat)

![Caught by Koneko](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.2-caught-by-koneko.jpg)

The plan was perfect. Except for one variable. As Ren and Issei crept toward the wall, a shadow fell over them. A petite girl with white hair stood on the fence. Koneko Toujou. She looked down at them. Her eyes were dead.

Koneko: "Disgusting."

Matsuda and Motohama ran away screaming. Issei froze, stuttering excuses. Ren stood up. He dusted off his knees. He looked Koneko in the eye.

Ren: "You caught us. Good positioning. You utilized the sun’s glare to mask your approach."

Koneko: "Pervert."

Ren: (Veritas) "Yes. I am. I'm a teenage boy with high testosterone and low impulse control. I wanted to see boobs. I failed. I accept my judgment."

Koneko blinked. She wasn't used to suspects confessing immediately.

Koneko: "Weirdo."

She punched Issei in the gut. Then she looked at Ren. She pulled back her fist. Ren saw it comiPeeping Strategyng. He tried to block—using a stance he learned from The God of High School (Mori Dan's Guard). WHACK. Koneko’s fist hit his forearms.

Physics: A Super-Strength Devil vs. A Normal Human.

Ren was lifted off his feet. He flew three meters and crashed into a pile of gym mats. His arms felt like they had been hit by a sledgehammer. Koneko: "Don't come back."

## 1.3 The Reality of the Grind (No PTD)
Location: Ren’s Apartment (Night).
Ren sat on his bed, icing his arms. They were swollen and purple. He wasn't angry at Koneko. He was angry at Physics.

Ren: "I blocked. My form was perfect. My center of gravity was low. Why did I fly?"

He looked at his bookshelf. It was filled with manga, manhua, manhwa, etc such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail, God of Highschool, The Gosu, Mercenary Enrollment, God of Blackfield, Return of Bloodthirsty Police, Metal Gear, Heavenly Demons Manhwas, Dragon Ball, etc.

More coming soon on: ...

Ren: "Because I'm soft. Issei took that punch and walked away groaning. I took it and my radius bone almost snapped. If I want to be the Harem King... I need to be tough. I need to be a Legend."

He stood up.

Ren: "I don't have a System. I don't have magic. I have Guts."

The Training Montage (The Failure):

![Mori Dan vs Mujin Mubong Park from God of Highschool chapter 543](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/moridan-vs-mujinpark-goh-543-cropped.jpg)

*Mori Dan vs Mujin Mubong Park from God of Highschool chapter 543*

He went to the local park. It was midnight. He started stretching. Then review the basics of martial arts which are moving, dodging, evading, blocking, parrying, striking, grappling, etc. Then he starts training what he watched in One Piece:
 * Goal: Iron Body (Tekkai) / Armament Hardening.
 * Method: He punched the oak tree.
   * Punch. Pain.
   * Punch. Skin tears.
   * Punch. "Harden! Visualize the black coating! Reject the impact!"

![One Piece chapter 1087 ship punching bag Garp and Kuzan.](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/one-piece-chapter-1087-colored-ship-punching-bag.webp)

Source: One Piece chapter 1087 colored version [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/15l08gf/one_piece_chapter_1087_colored/?rdt=56489](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/15l08gf/one_piece_chapter_1087_colored/?rdt=56489).

He punched until his knuckles bled. He screamed, pouring his Will into his fist. Although he learned how to harden his body but the skin didn't turn black. It just turned red. The tree didn't break. Ren broke. He collapsed on the grass, panting, his hand shaking uncontrollably.

Ren: "It's not working. In the anime, they get stronger when they bleed. I just get... damaged."

He stared at the moon.

Ren: "Maybe I'm just an NPC. Maybe the physics engine of this world doesn't support energy."

## 1.4 The Bridge (The Divergence)

![Yuuma Amano](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.4-yuuma-amano.jpg)

Timeline: Few Days Later. After School.
Ren was walking home with Issei. Ren’s hand was bandaged.

Issei: "Dude, what happened to your hand? Did you fight a bear?"
Ren: "I fought a tree. The tree won."

They reached the bridge. A girl was waiting. Yuuma Amano (Raynare). She approached Issei. She asked him out. Ren stood there. He watched Yuuma. He felt... unsettled.
His Observation (Intuition) was screaming. She's too pretty. Issei is... well, Issei. Why him? Why not me? A spike of Envy hit him. I train every night. I study tactics. I'm fearless. Issei just reads porn. Why does he get the girl? But then, Veritas kicked in.

Ren: "Hey."
Yuuma looked at him. Her eyes were cold.
Ren: "Issei is gullible. He falls in love with anything that smiles. If you hurt him, I won't be polite."
Yuuma smiled. It didn't reach her eyes.
Yuuma: "I would never hurt him. He's... special."

Ren's Internal Monologue: Special. That word again. Everyone is special except me.
Ren forced a smile. "Congrats, Issei. You did it. You're the protagonist today."
Issei cheered. "I'm gonna plan the best date ever! Ren, I need your tactical advice!"
Ren nodded. "Yeah. Sure. I'll help you plan."

As they walked away, Ren looked back at Yuuma. She was staring at Issei’s back like a hawk staring at a mouse. Ren felt a chill. I should tell him to run. But... maybe I'm just jealous. Maybe I want him to fail so I can feel better.

Ren: "No. I'm not that guy. I'm his friend."

He clenched his bandaged fist. The pain grounded him. "I'll keep an eye on them. Just in case."

## 📈 Status Update
 * Ren: PHY is Average (Human). Training: Failed (Injury). Motivation: High (Desire for Girls/Respect), but tainted by Envy.
 * Relationship: Issei's Best Friend / Strategist.
 * The Power Gap: Ren realizes that "Willpower" alone isn't bending physics yet. He is hitting the glass ceiling of his humanity.

# 🌑 Chapter 2: The Hero Who Bled
Timeline: Sunday Morning \rightarrow Sunset.
Location: Ren’s Apartment / The Park Fountain.

## 2.1 The Interlude: Tuning the Radio to "Hell"
Ren sat in the center of his room. The blinds were drawn. It was pitch black. His arms still ached from the tree-punching failure.

Ren: "Physical conditioning takes years. The date is today. I need a shortcut. I need Observation."

He closed his eyes. He tried to mimic the anime descriptions of Ki or Haki.

![Videl from Dragon Ball Z first time learning ki/qi/chi](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/videl-learning-ki.jpeg)

*Videl from Dragon Ball Z first time learning ki/qi/chi source [https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JH5olp4xI/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JH5olp4xI/)*

"Feel the life force. Feel the presence of living things."

![Luffy training blindfolded with Rayleigh](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/one-piece-luffy-training-observation-haki-rayleigh.avif)

*Luffy training blindfolded with Rayleigh source [https://screenrant.com/one-piece-luffy-nika-joyboy-twist-foreshadowed-rayleigh/](https://screenrant.com/one-piece-luffy-nika-joyboy-twist-foreshadowed-rayleigh/)*

He reached out with his mind.

Result: Silence.

He felt nothing. No "spark." No "voice." Just the hum of the refrigerator.

Ren: "Dammit. I'm empty. I have no Spirit."

Frustration bubbled up. A dark, oily feeling in his gut. Why can't I do it? Even Videl can learn how to use ki/qi/chi and can even fly. I'm sitting here in the dark like a loser. But what is this dark feeling?

The Shift:

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVxTo7y98cs" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

He stopped trying to push the negative feelings away. He focused on them. Envy. Fear. The cold knot in his stomach. Suddenly, the "static" in his head cleared. He didn't sense the birds outside. He didn't sense the neighbors laughing. He sensed... Pressure. He felt a cold spot in the corner of the room where a spider was killing a fly. He felt the "Malice" of the dying insect.

Ren: (Opening his eyes, sweating) "I can't hear the Light. I can only hear the Pain."

He looked at his hands. They were trembling.

Ren: "Fine. If the radio only plays the horror channel... I'll listen to the horror."

## 2.2 The Stalking Mission (Tactical Shadow)

![bad feeling yuuma amano](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.2-bad-feeling-yuuma-amano.jpg)

Time: 4:00 PM.
Location: The Shopping District.

Issei was on his date. He looked ecstatic, buying crepes for Yuuma. Ren was fifty meters back, wearing a nondescript hoodie and sunglasses. He wasn't using magic stealth; he was using social engineering—blending into crowds, using reflections in shop windows. He looks happy, Ren thought. He looks like a protagonist. A pang of jealousy hit Ren. It was sharp and ugly.
I wish that was me. Ren clamped down on the thought. Veritas. "I am jealous. But I am also his friend. I will not let him die just because I'm bitter." He focused on Yuuma Amano. Using his new "Dark Observation," he tried to read her. He didn't feel "Love." He felt a Void. A cold, gaping hunger hidden behind a smile. It felt like standing next to a cliff edge in the dark.

Ren: "She's not a girl. She's a trap."

## 2.3 The Sunset Confrontation

![Yuuma Amano revelation.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.3-yuuma-amano-revelation.jpg)

Location: The Park Fountain.

The sun set. The park emptied. The sky turned purple. Ren hid behind the public restrooms. His heart was hammering against his ribs. This is it. The atmosphere just got heavy.

Yuuma: "Issei-kun... would you die for me?"

Ren saw the feathers. He saw the black wings explode from her back.

Raynare: "Goodbye, Issei."

She summoned the Light Spear. Issei froze, his brain unable to process the horror. Ren's Choice: Ariel shouted to stop her. Ren knew shouting wouldn't work. He wasn't a King; he was a soldier. Move. Don't think. Move.
Ren sprinted. He burst from cover. He didn't have Burst Speed. He had adrenaline. He didn't have a plan to fight her. He had a plan to take the hit.

Ren: "ISSEI!"

## 2.4 The Collision (Reality Check)

![Yuuma Amano confrontation.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.4-yuuma-amano-confrontation.jpg)

Raynare thrust the spear down. Ren dove. He tackled Issei around the waist, slamming both of them to the hard pavement just as the spear stabbed the air where Issei’s heart had been. CRASH. They rolled on the concrete. Issei gasped, bewildered.

Issei: "Ren?!"

Raynare hovered above them, looking annoyed. Not scared. Not wary. Just... mildly irritated. Like a human spotting a second cockroach.

Raynare: "Another one? You insects are multiplying."

Ren scrambled up, putting himself between Raynare and Issei. He raised his fists in a boxing stance.

Ren: "Run, Issei! She's a monster!"
Issei: "But... Yuuma..."
Raynare: "Brave." She sneered. "But bravery without power is just suicide."

She didn't use a spear. She just flew forward and kicked Ren. It was a casual kick. A swat. But she was a Fallen Angel. Her physical stats were supernatural. CRACK. Ren tried to block. His forearms snapped. The force lifted him off his feet and threw him ten meters into a tree. He hit the trunk with a sickening thud and collapsed, coughing blood.

Ren: (Wheezing) "Damn... it... physics..."
Raynare: "Stay down, trash. I'll deal with you after I harvest the Gear."

She turned back to Issei. Issei was paralyzed with terror, looking at Ren's broken body.

Issei: "Ren... you killed him..."
Raynare: "Not yet. But I will kill you."

She summoned a second spear. She threw it. Ren watched from the grass, vision blurring, unable to move his broken arms. I saved him... but I didn't save him. The spear pierced Issei’s stomach. Issei screamed and fell into the fountain.

## 2.5 The Pity of the Crimson Princess

![Rias carrying Issei leaving Ren behind.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.5-rias-carrying-issei-leaving-ren-behind.jpg)

Raynare flew off, laughing. She left Ren alive because he wasn't worth the mana it would take to kill him. He was insignificant. Ren crawled toward the fountain. He dragged his broken body through the mud.

Ren: "Issei... hang on..."

Then, the crimson light appeared. Rias Gremory materialized. She looked like a goddess descending. She walked straight to Issei. She knelt in the blood-water.

Rias: "You have a strong destiny, boy. Live for me."

Ren watched as she placed the Pawn piece in Issei. He saw the care in her eyes. He saw the gentle way she brushed Issei's hair. She's looking at him like he's a treasure. Then, Rias stood up. She looked around. She spotted Ren lying in the dirt, broken and bloody. Her expression shifted. The warmth vanished, replaced by professional pity.

Rias: "A witness. And a brave one."

She walked over. She scanned him. Scan: Human. No Sacred Gear. Moderate physical damage.

Rias: "You tried to protect him. That is commendable."

She cast a simple healing spell. A green light washed over Ren. His bones knit together painfully. The bleeding stopped.

Rias: "Sleep now. Forget this nightmare."

She raised her hand to wipe his memory.

Ren: (Gritting his teeth) "Don't."

Rias paused. "Excuse me?"

Ren: "Don't... touch my mind. I want... to remember that I failed."

Rias looked at him. She saw the raw, ugly Truth in his eyes. It wasn't the fire of a hero. It was the cold ash of a survivor.

Rias: "Very well. If you wish to carry this burden, so be it."

She turned back to Issei. She picked up the unconscious Issei (her new Pawn) and prepared to teleport. She didn't offer Ren a ride. She didn't offer him power. She just nodded politely.

Rias: "Goodbye, brave human."

She vanished. Ren was left alone in the dark park. He was healed, but he was empty.

## 2.6 The Aftermath (The Seed of Darkness)

<iframe width="725" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3QJ8Pgjj3c?start=230" title="Harbingers - Gul&#39;dan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Guldan Harbringer from World of Warcraft where he is rejected by the people, rejected by the elements, so the final force that offer his destiny is chaos the burning legion. The climax is in 03:50.*

Ren sat up. He looked at his hands. They were clean. The magic had erased the scars. But he could still feel the snap of his bones.

Ren: "I tackled him. I took the hit. I stood my ground."

He looked at the empty fountain where Issei had been chosen by a Devil King.

Ren: "She called me 'Brave Human.' Like you talk to a dog that barked at a bear."

He punched the ground.

Ren: "It's not enough. Being brave isn't enough. Being right isn't enough."
A shadow stretched out from the tree line. It seemed to curl around Ren’s fist, comforting him. The "Malice" he had sensed earlier... it felt closer now. It felt like it understood him.

Ren: "Light rejected me. But this... this cold feeling..."

He clenched his fist, and for a second, the shadow didn't retreat. It clung to his skin.

Ren: "If the Light won't give me a weapon... I'll forge one from the Dark."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren: Physically healed (Magic). Emotionally shattered. Awakening: Affinity for Darkness confirmed. Motivation: To stop being "insignificant."
 * Issei: Dead and Reincarnated.
 * The Difference: Ariel was respected as an anomaly. Ren was pitied as a civilian.

# 🌑 Chapter 3: The False Dream and The Rotting Fist
Timeline: Monday (The Day After the Park Incident).
Location: Kuoh Academy / The Abandoned Park.

## 3.1 The Morning After (The Wall of Silence)

![](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/)

Ren walked into class 2-B. His arms were stiff, phantom pains radiating from where the bones had snapped the night before. Rias's magic was flawless physically, but the memory of the crack remained. He saw Issei. The protagonist looked... fine. Better than fine. He was glowing with a nervous, excited energy. He was staring at Rias Gremory (who was sitting in her usual seat) with a blush on his face.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
He died yesterday. I watched the light leave his eyes. And now he's blushing at the girl who treated me like a stray dog.

The Perverted Trio Reunion:
Matsuda and Motohama rushed Issei.

Matsuda: "Issei! You traitor! You got a girlfriend and ditched us!"
Issei: (Laughing nervously) "Ah, no! She... uh... moved away! It didn't work out!"
Issei looked at Ren. His eyes darted away. Guilt. Rias had ordered him to keep the Devil world secret.
Issei: "Hey, Ren. Crazy weekend, huh?"
Ren: "Yeah. Crazy."

## 3.2 The Roof (Veritas)

![](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/)

Lunchtime. Ren dragged Issei to the roof. He didn't beat around the bush.

Ren: "Drop the act, Issei. You're terrible at lying." Issei flinched. "What act? Yuuma just—"
Ren: "Yuuma was a Fallen Angel. She put a light spear through your stomach. I tackled you. She broke my arms. Then the Crimson-Haired Princess showed up and resurrected you."
Issei stared, his mouth gaping. "You... you remember? Buchou said she wiped your memory!"
Ren: "She tried but I faced her asking her not to erase my memory. She respected my wish. I guess I'm too stubborn to forget." (Ren tapped his temple). "Veritas, remember? I don't do lies."
Issei slumped against the railing, sliding down to sit on the concrete.
Issei: "It's true. I'm a Devil now, Ren. Rias-senpai... she saved me. I'm her Pawn." Issei looked at his hand.
Issei: "It's kinda terrifying. But... she's giving me a chance. To be strong. To be the Harem King for real."

Ren looked at his friend. He saw the hope. He felt the pang of Envy—sharp and hot. He got a reset button. He got a new game plus. But Ren forced a smile. It was a genuine smile, strained by pain.

Ren: "That's awesome, man. Seriously. You're living the anime life."
Issei: "I can't tell anyone else. But... I'm glad you know. I was scared I'd have to lie to you forever."
Ren: "We're the Perverted Quartet. We don't lie about the important stuff."

Ren offered a fist bump. Issei bumped it. Ren felt the difference immediately. Issei's fist felt heavy. Solid. Even without the Gauntlet, the Devil physiology was already making him denser. Ren’s hand felt frail in comparison.

Ren skipped the peeping mission that afternoon.
Ren: "I have to study math."
Issei: "Since when do you study?"
Ren: "Since I realized I'm falling behind."

Ren skipped the peeping mission that afternoon. He didn't even make an excuse this time. He just walked away, the cheerful banter of Issei, Matsuda, and Motohama fading behind him.

He went to the park. Not the park where they almost died, but the one near his home. The sun was setting, bleeding orange across the sky. The same park where he had once sat with Issei, dreaming of normal, perverted futures.

He found the largest oak tree. Its trunk was thick, ancient, unyielding. He didn't wrap his hands in bandages. He didn't bother. There was no one to hide the bruising from. No one to impress.

He stood before it, his chest heavy. The image of Rias Gremory, her crimson hair flowing, her smile radiating, choosing Issei... it replayed in his mind. He was the one who had seen her first. He was the one who had tried to warn Issei. But Issei was the one chosen. Chosen for power. Chosen for... everything.

Ren closed his eyes. He didn't visualize Garp. He didn't think of Haki. He just thought of effort. It was all he had ever known. All he had ever been.

He clenched his bare fist and drove it into the rough bark. THUD. Pain shot up his wrist, raw and immediate. The bark didn't crack. Not even a dent.

Ren panted. "Again." THUD. His knuckles split. Blood welled up, mixing with the rough texture of the bark. With his knuckles bleeding, he punched again. And again. And again. When his knuckles reached their limits, he switched to his legs, kicking the tree with all his might.

"Why?!" he screamed, his voice raw, echoing in the empty park. "Why isn't it enough?!"

He kept hitting. Punch after punch and kick after kick. His form was impeccable, his Will was absolute, his Energy focused. But the tree stood unmoved, a cruel monument to his inadequacy. His body was a human body, and it was failing him.

The sun dipped below the horizon, plunging the park into twilight. Ren collapsed to his knees at the foot of the tree, his hands and legs are mangled mess of blood and splinters. He pressed his face against the rough bark, and the tears finally came. He cried for his useless effort. He cried for the future that was stolen before it even began. He cried for the simple, painful truth:

He had no talent.

No hidden power. No divine gift. Just his fists, his effort, and a cold, empty echo where a dragon's roar should have been.

"I just... wanted to keep up," he sobbed, his voice muffled by the bark. "I just wanted to be... useful."

Unlike Rock Lee, there was no Guy-sensei to find him. No comforting words about the "talent for hard work." There was only the night, the indifferent tree, and the overwhelming, crushing weight of his own solitude. He was alone, utterly and completely, in the face of a world that didn't care for his effort.

He cried until his throat was hoarse, until the moon was high. He had nothing left but the pain, and a terrifying, cold resolve hardening in the shattered fragments of his heart.

Ren sat at the base of the tree, his energy spent, his tears dried into salt tracks on his face. The park was silent, save for the distant chirping of crickets.

The darkness of the night felt heavy, pressing down on him. But for the first time, he didn't try to push it away with "burning spirit" or "youthful passion." He was too tired for passion.

His mind drifted to the Occult Research Club. To the warmth of that room. Issei was probably there right now. Maybe Rias was teaching him magic. Maybe Akeno was serving him tea. They were in the light. Issei was getting stronger just by breathing, supported by a destiny that had hand-picked him.

"It's not fair," Ren whispered. The words tasted like ash.

He didn't suppress the envy this time. He didn't tell himself to be a "good friend." He let the ugly, cold feeling sit in his chest. It felt like lead. It felt like a black hole swallowing his hope.

He looked at his mangled hand. He had tried to be Garp—the Iron Fist. He had tried to be a diamond. But diamonds are made of light and pressure. Ren was just... empty.

"If I can't be hard like a diamond..." Ren murmured, his eyes dull. "Maybe I can just be... heavy. Like the nothingness I feel right now."

He stood up, swaying slightly. He approached the tree again. He didn't take a stance. He didn't visualize armor. He visualized **Despair**. He channeled the feeling of being left behind, the feeling of being the "zero" in the equation.

He threw a punch. It wasn't fast. It wasn't explosive. It was just... heavy. A conduit for his hollowness.

*Thump.*

The sound was wrong. It wasn't the sharp *crack* of wood splitting. It was a muffled, dead sound. Like hitting a bag of wet sand.

Ren pulled his hand back. There was no crater. The bark wasn't shattered. But where his knuckles had connected, the wood had turned a lifeless grey. A perfect circle of rot. He touched it lightly, and the solid oak crumbled into fine, grey dust under his fingertip.

"I didn't break it with force," Ren realized, his voice trembling. "I... killed it."

## 3.5 The Verdict

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMMe96KYhyg?start=179" title="Kingdom Hearts Union Cross Theater Day Break Town 33. Confrontation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ren stared at the grey patch on the tree. The "Darkness" faded from his hand, leaving his skin cold and clammy.

This wasn't the heroic power of Garp. Garp breaks mountains with laughter and love. This... this was entropy. This was the touch of the grave. He had introduced a void into the wood that the living structure couldn't survive.

"It's ugly," Ren whispered. He felt a wave of nausea. "It's a villain's power."

He thought of the Legends. Ryu would reject this. Batman would warn against it. It was unstable, malicious, and born of envy.

But then he thought of Rias's pitying smile. He thought of Issei standing in front of him, protecting him.

He clenched his fist, ignoring the stinging pain of his split skin.

"But it worked."

He resumed his stance. The tears were gone, replaced by a hollow, terrifying calm.

"I don't care if it's ugly," Ren said to the darkness. "I don't care if it stains me. If the Light won't let me stand next to them... then I'll drag the enemies into the Dark."

He punched the tree again. And again. He wasn't training to be a "Hero of Light" anymore. He was training to perfect the Rotting Fist. After that, he practice incorporating into the rest of his martial arts.

***

### 📈 Status Update
* **Ren:**
    * **Friendship:** Maintained with Issei on the surface, but a "Secret Wall" of envy and inferiority has been erected.
    * **Ability Unlocked:** **Void Armament (Prototype).**
        * *Effect:* It does **not** harden his skin or increase his defense (he still takes full damage).
        * *Function:* It applies "Entropy" to the target upon contact, eroding durability and kinetic energy. It turns solid matter into dust and weakens living tissue.
    * **Mental State:** Darkening. He has stopped trying to emulate the "Hope" of the Legends and has begun to emulate their "Lethality." He accepts negative emotion not as a weakness, but as his only available fuel source.

# 🌑 Chapter 4: The Sickening Fist and The Empty Girl
Timeline: Tuesday Afternoon (After School).
Location: Back Alley near Kuoh Academy / The Park.

## ‎4.1 The Live Test (The Ugly Truth)
‎Ren didn't go straight to the park. He needed to know if his power of decay worked on flesh in a real combat scenario. A tree doesn't fight back; people do. And unlike the legends he admired, he didn't have the luxury of honor.
‎He found a group of three thugs from a neighboring technical high school harassing a Kendo club junior in a narrow alleyway.

‎Ren: "Hey. Leave him alone."
‎Thug Leader: "Hah? You want to play hero, Kuoh-boy?"

‎The leader swung a metal baseball bat with intent to break bones. ‎Ren didn't dodge. He stepped in, his mind shifting into the cold, analytical state of the Mercenary. ‎Ren's Thought: Focus on the Cold. Reject the kinetic energy. Accept the Void. ‎He caught the barrel of the bat with his open left hand.

‎[Technique: Void Dampening]

‎The bat didn't stop with a sharp impact; it felt like it hit a pool of deep tar. The momentum just... died. The vibration vanished instantly. ‎The thug blinked, trying to pull the bat back, but it felt stuck in gravity. 

"What the—?"

‎Ren clenched his right fist. He didn't just harden it; he filled the space around his knuckles with Entropy. He pivoted his hips, executing a flawless karate reverse punch.
‎Thump. ‎He struck the thug in the solar plexus.
‎It wasn't a satisfying smack of skin on skin. It was a wet, muffled thud. ‎The thug’s eyes rolled back. He collapsed instantly, retching bile. Where Ren had hit him, the skin wasn't just bruised; it was grey and cold to the touch, as if the life force had been sucked out of the tissue.

‎Thug 2: "You bastard!"

‎The second thug charged, throwing a wild haymaker. ‎Ren didn't panic. He slipped the punch using Void Sense—sensing the empty space in the attacker's guard. He weaved inside.
‎Ren: Martial Arts plus Decay. Combine them.
‎Ren used a palm strike to the thug's shoulder joint.

‎[Technique: Withering Palm]

‎Pop. ‎The thug screamed not because the bone broke, but because the muscle suddenly lost all tension. His arm went dead, hanging limp and grey at his side. ‎Ren followed up with a leg sweep, but he coated his shin in the Void. When he connected with the thug's ankles, it didn't just trip him; it sapped the strength from his legs. The thug hit the ground and couldn't stand back up.

‎Thug 3: (Backing away, trembling) "What... what did you do to them?"

‎Ren looked at the last standing thug. He didn't raise his fists. He just projected his Presence—or rather, the lack of it. The Nurarihyon style of fear.

‎Ren: "Leave. Before you rot."

‎The third thug scrambled over his friends and ran, screaming. ‎Ren looked at his hands. No pain. No nausea. The Darkness felt natural now, like a second skin.

‎Ren: "Issei gets a cool dragon claw. I get the poison. Figures."

‎He turned to the Kendo junior he had saved. Ideally, this was the part where the victim thanked the hero. ‎But the boy was pressed against the brick wall, his face pale, staring at the grey, necrotic bruise on the leader's chest.

‎Kendo Junior: "You... you're a monster..."

‎The boy didn't say thank you. He grabbed his bag and ran away, terrified of his savior.
‎Ren stood alone in the alley. He didn't feel hurt. He just felt Validated.

‎Ren: "I'm not a Hero. I'm the thing that scares the bad guys."

‎## 4.2 The Meeting (The Park)
‎​Ren washed his hands in a public fountain, though there was no blood to wash off. He met Issei at the park bench.
‎
‎​Issei: "Ren! There you are! You missed the arcade!"
‎​Ren: "Had to run an errand. So, the Fallen Angels are active?"
‎​Issei: "Yeah. I can feel... something. My Gauntlet keeps twitching."
‎
‎​Then, she appeared. Asia Argento tripped out of the bushes, landing face-first.
‎"Ouchie..."
‎​Issei blushed immediately, his hero complex kicking in. "A nun? She's cute!"
‎​Ren looked at her. He activated his Observation (Void Sense). To Ariel (in the other timeline), she looked like a beacon of Kindness. To Ren, she looked like a Hollow Shell. ​Ren's Perspective: He didn't see a golden aura. He saw a girl who had no tether to the world. She felt like she was already dead, just waiting for gravity to realize it. She’s just like me, Ren realized with a jolt of sympathy. She doesn't belong here.
‎
## ‎4.​3 The Interaction (Veritas)
‎​Issei helped her up. 
‎"Are you okay? I'm Hyoudou Issei!" ​
‎Asia smiled, but Ren saw the cracks in it. 
‎"I am Asia Argento. I am lost." ​
‎
‎Ren stepped forward. He didn't try to be cool. He spoke softly, his voice devoid of Issei's naive optimism.
‎
Ren: "You're not just lost on the map, are you?"
‎
​Asia looked at him, startled. She saw Ren’s eyes—dark, tired, and brutally honest.
‎
Asia: "I... pardon?"
‎​Ren: "You have the eyes of someone who is waiting to be punished."
‎​Issei elbowed Ren. "Dude! Don't be creepy! She's a nun!"
‎​Ren: "I'm being honest, Issei. Look at her. No luggage. No phone. Walking into a Devil-controlled territory alone. Asia, who sent you here?"
‎​Asia shrank back. "I... I follow the Lord's guidance."
‎​Ren: "The Lord doesn't send sheep into a wolf den without a shepherd. Someone is using you as bait."
‎
​Asia began to tremble. Ren sighed. He hated being right. He reached out with his hand and gently patted her head. He was careful to suppress the Void, offering only human warmth.
‎
Ren: "It's okay. I'm used to being bait too."
‎
​Asia looked up at him. For the first time, her smile reached her eyes. It wasn't a "Saintly" smile; it was a lonely girl finding another lonely soul.
‎
Asia: "You are very kind, mister..."
‎​Ren: "Ren. Just Ren. The guy in the background."

## 4.​4 The Shadow on the Hill
​They walked her to the church. Ren walked behind them, scanning the tree line. He didn't sense "Killing Intent." He sensed Empty Spaces in the foliage where birds weren't singing.
There. And there. Two watchers. He felt the pressure of their gaze. It felt heavy, arrogant.

​Issei: "This place gives me the creeps."
​Ren: "It should. It smells like a trap."

​They reached the gate. Asia turned to them.
Asia: "Thank you. Please... don't come closer. It is dangerous."
​Ren: "We know."
​Issei: "We can't just leave you!"
​Ren: "Issei." Ren grabbed Issei's shoulder. "We leave. Now."
​Issei: "But—!"
​Ren: "Use your head. Look at the shadows in the trees. We are being watched. If we fight now, we die, and she gets punished for bringing us here."

​Issei looked at Ren's serious face. He realized his friend wasn't being cowardly; he was being Tactical.

Issei: "Okay. We retreat."

​They watched Asia walk into the dark church. As the doors closed, Ren looked up at the steeple. He saw the black-winged silhouette (Raynare).
​He didn't glare. He stared with Dead Calm. I see you. You think I'm nothing. You're right. But even nothing can choke you.

## 4.​5 The Vow
​They walked back to the city in silence.

Issei: "She's gonna die in there, isn't she?"
​Ren: "Probably. Unless we change the script."
​Issei: "How? I'm just a Pawn."

​Ren stopped. He looked at a streetlamp flickering in the dark.

Ren: "Light attracts monsters, Issei. You be the Light. You be the Hero. Charge in the front door. Scream. Glow. Be the distraction."
​Issei: "And you?"

​Ren looked at his hand. He flexed his fingers, feeling the Void hum beneath his skin. It was ugly power, but it was his.

Ren: "I'll be the Shadow. I won't fight fair. I won't fight honorably. I'm going to sneak in the back and rot them from the inside out while they're looking at you."
​Ren: "You save the girl. I'll bury the trash."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Power: Void Fist (Touch of Decay) confirmed effective.
   * Mental State: Accepting his role as the "Dirty Fighter" / "Shadow."
   * Relationship: Connected with Asia through shared loneliness.
 * Issei: Realizes Ren is hurting himself to keep up. Feels guilty but motivated.
 * The Enemy: Sees two weak humans. Zero threat level assigned.

# 🌑 Chapter 5: The Sewer Rat and The Stray Dog
Timeline: Thursday (The Day of the Ritual).
Location: Kuoh Hardware District / The Abandoned Church.

## 5.1 The Preparation (The Weapons of the Weak)

Yesterday night, Ren review his martial arts for a very short time. Then review how to survive on the battle field by practicing crouching, crawling, rolling, sneaking, and practice fighting using his kitchen knife. He ends the night by a good shower and meditation plus relaxation until he fell asleep.

In other words,Ren didn't sleep immediately. He pushed the furniture in his small apartment to the walls. He held his cheap kitchen knife in a reverse grip. It felt light. Too light. He practiced the motions of the Void Fist, but with a blade. Slash. Step. Stab. Absorb. ​He spent an hour crawling on his stomach across the floor, practicing silent movement. He rolled over imaginary tripwires. He crouched in the corner, controlling his breathing until his heart rate dropped to 45 BPM. 

Ren: "I am not a warrior. I am a rat. Rats survive."

​He ended the night with a cold shower to numb his bruising, followed by twenty minutes of Void Meditation—emptying his mind of fear and filling it with the cold resolve of the task ahead. Before he slept dreamlessly, he tried feeling all parts of his body, relax them, try to smoothen his body awareness flow hoping to be able to use energy like chi/qi/ki as the void energy can't be applied for this kind of thing yet. He may not be able to use energy yet but he was able to recover faster than normal humans because of how fluid his body awareness is.

Ren skipped school. He stood in the hardware store aisle, staring at the shelves.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
I don't know what we're walking into. Magic? Lasers? Monsters? I can't fight those. I need to bring the fight down to the gutter. He didn't buy high-tech gadgets. He bought street weapons.

 * Bear Mace (Capsicum Spray): If they have eyes, they can be blinded.
 * Bag of Fine Sand: For throwing. Oldest trick in the book.
 * Steel Pipe (threaded end): A sword breaks. A pipe just bends.
 * ​Duct Tape: To strap his wrists and secure his grip.

​The Knife Selection:
Ren stared at the cutting tools. He ignored the flimsy box cutters. He needed something that wouldn't snap when it hit a bone or light-armor. He picked up a Heavy-Duty Outdoor Utility Knife. ​Features: Fixed blade (no folding mechanism to fail), rubberized grip (good for bloody hands), thick spine. It was a tool meant for cutting drywall and stripping wire. ​Ren's Thought: It’s not a katana. It’s a tool. Good. I’m just doing maintenance on the enemy.

​The Chemistry:
He moved to the pharmacy aisle. ​Caffeine Pills (200mg): Stimulants. I need my nerves vibrating. I need to react faster than humanly possible. ​High-Calorie Energy Jelly: Fuel. The Void eats my stamina. I need sugar. ​Ibuprofen (Painkillers): For later. Taking them now would thin my blood. I need the pain to keep me sharp. ​Consumption Strategy: He pocketed the Caffeine. I'll take two pills thirty minutes before we breach. That gives me a 4-hour window of heightened awareness before the crash.

​The Checkout
​He dumped the items on the counter. The clerk looked at the pipe, the duct tape, the knife, and the caffeine pills.

Clerk: "Big project?"
Ren: "Renovating a church." (Veritas).

​He walked out of the store, the plastic bag heavy in his hand. He looked at the sky.

Ren: "Issei gets a magic dragon gauntlet. I get a pipe and sand."
​He laughed, a dry, humorless sound.
Ren: "This really is a Kusoge (Trash Game)."

He went home to take a break. He performed one last meditation. Before leaving, he stretch his body to prepare for battle.

## 5.2 The Scouting (The Path of the Rat)
Time: 5:00 PM (One hour before sunset).
Ren met Issei. He was wearing the black coat he had modified—duct tape wrapped around his forearms as makeshift bracers. He handed Issei a bag of flour (purchased separately).

​Issei: "You look... intense, Ren."
​Ren: "I'm caffeinated. Listen, here is the loadout."

​Ren popped two caffeine pills dry. He swallowed them, feeling the chemical bitterness hit his throat. His eyes widened slightly as the stimulant hit his bloodstream, sharpening his Observation.

​Ren: "I scouted the perimeter. The front door is thick oak. You kick that down. Make noise. Scream about being the Harem King. Draw every eye in the room."
​Issei: "And you?"
​Ren pointed to a squiggly line on the back of the church map he drew.
Ren: "There's a storm drain. It leads into the crypts beneath the altar. The grate is rusted through."
​Issei: "Dude... you're going in through the sewer? That's gross."
​Ren: "Heroes use the front door, Issei. Rats use the walls. I'm going to pop up behind them while they're laughing at you."
​Ren looked Issei in the eye. Veritas.
Ren: "I'm not strong enough to fight them fair, Issei. If I stand next to you, I'm just a hostage. I have to be the knife they don't see."
​Issei nodded, solemn. "Okay. I'll be loud. I'll be the loudest decoy ever."
​Ren: "Let's go. The drugs are kicking in, and I feel like punching a priest."

## 5.3 The Assault (The Dust and The Shadow)
Timeline: Sunset (06:00 PM).
Location: The Abandoned Church (Main Hall / Crypts).

The sky outside bruised a deep purple. Inside the church, the chanting had begun—a low, dissonant hum that vibrated in Issei’s teeth.

The Front Door:
Issei stood before the massive oak doors. He checked the bag of flour Ren had given him. He felt ridiculous, but he trusted the plan.

Issei: "Okay. Be loud. Be the Hero."
CRASH.
Issei kicked the double doors open. The wood splintered.
Issei: "HEY! BIRD-LADY! I'M HERE FOR THE GIRL!"
The chanting stopped. The Fallen Angels (Raynare, Mittelt, Kalawarner) and Freed looked toward the entrance.
Raynare: "The Pawn? Alone?"

Issei didn't wait for a monologue. He ripped the bag of flour open and hurled the contents into the air with a wide, sweeping motion. The white powder filled the entryway, creating a dense, choking fog that obscured his position.

Mittelt: "Cough! What is this? Dust?"
Freed: "He's blinding us! Kill him!"

The Sewer:
While the Fallen Angels focused on the white cloud at the entrance, a rusted grate beneath the altar shifted silently. Ren pushed it up. The smell of the sewer clung to him, masking his human scent. He crawled out into the shadows behind the pulpit. He was covered in muck, his black coat smeared with grime, but his eyes were dilated and sharp from the caffeine. He saw Asia tied to the cross.
He saw Freed Sellzen dashing toward Issei's smoke screen. He saw Raynare hovering above, annoyed.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
Target identified. The Priest is the ground threat. The Angels are distracted. Time to be the rat.

## 5.4 The Ambush (Steel vs. Light)
Freed charged into the flour cloud, his Light Sword glowing.

Freed: "Come out, little devil! I'll slice you!"
Issei: "Over here, freak!"
Issei, utilizing the cover, dodged left. Freed slashed empty air.

Ren: Now.
Ren burst from the shadows behind the altar. He didn't scream. He moved with the fluid body awareness he had practiced the night before.
He sprinted at Freed’s exposed back.

Step 1: The Blinder.
Ren reached into his pocket and threw the Sand.
Whoosh. The grit hit the back of Freed's head and neck, some of it wrapping around to his eyes as he turned.
Freed: "GAH! Dirt?!"

Step 2: The Crippler.
Ren drew the Steel Pipe. He didn't aim for the head (too hard to hit). He aimed for the wrist holding the Light Sword. He swung with both hands, putting his hip rotation into it. CLANG. The galvanized steel connected with Freed’s forearm. Bone crunched. Freed howled and dropped the Light Sword. It hissed as it hit the stone floor.
Freed: "YOU!"

Step 3: The Void Fist.
Ren didn't stop. He dropped the pipe (it was bent now anyway) and stepped inside Freed’s guard.

Ren: Relax. Flow. Decay.

He grabbed Freed’s vest with his left hand to anchor him. He drove his right hand—holding the Heavy-Duty Utility Knife in a reverse grip—toward Freed’s shoulder joint. SHK. The blade sank deep. But Ren didn't just stab; he pulsed his Void. The wound turned grey instantly. The blood didn't spray; it thickened and blackened. The muscles around the stab wound withered, losing their tension.

Freed: "AAAAHH! WHAT IS THAT?! IT'S COLD!"
Freed, fueled by insane adrenaline and enhanced strength, backhanded Ren. SMACK. Ren flew back, skidding across the floor. He tasted copper. His nose was bleeding again. But he grinned. Freed’s sword arm was hanging limp, the shoulder rotting from the inside.
Ren: "Issei! Get Asia! I broke his wing!"

## 5.5 The Glitch (The Phase Shift)
Issei charged past the writhing Priest toward the altar.

Issei: "Asia! Hang on!"
Raynare: "Annoying insects."
Raynare descended. She ignored Issei and looked at Ren.
Raynare: "You. The one from the park. You fight dirty."

She summoned a Light Spear. Ren scrambled to his feet. He pulled out the Bear Mace. Spray. A stream of high-concentrated capsicum fired at Raynare. 

She flinched, shielding her eyes with a wing. "Chemicals?! Do you have no pride?!"
Ren: "I'm a human fighting monsters. Pride is for corpses."

Freed recovered. He picked up his Light Sword with his good left hand. His face was twisted in psychotic rage.

Freed: "I'm going to gut you! I'm going to carve the sins out of your belly!"

Freed lunged. He was fast—faster than Ren could track visually. The Light Sword swung horizontally, aiming to decapitate Ren.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
Too fast. Can't dodge. Can't block (Pipe is gone). I'm dead. Time seemed to slow. Ren looked at the blade of pure light. He remembered his meditation. The feeling of Emptiness. If I am not here... he cannot cut me. Be the Void. Reject existence. Ren didn't raise his hands to block. He instinctively tried to "erase" his own presence in the path of the blade. The shadows in the corner of the church lurch toward him, responding to his desperate affinity. SWISH. The Light Sword passed through Ren’s neck. It didn't decapitate him. For a micro-second, Ren’s neck flickered like a bad hologram. The blade passed through a hazy, grey blur where flesh should have been.

[Technique: Phase Shift (Glitch) - Awakened]

Freed stumbled, his swing hitting nothing but air.

Freed: "Hah?! I felt bone! Where did you go?!"
Ren gasped, clutching his throat. It was cold—freezing cold. But his head was still attached.
Ren: "I... I wasn't there."

## 5.6 The Sacrifice (Revisited)
The moment of shock was broken by Raynare.
Raynare: "Enough of this circus."
She hovered above the altar. She had two targets: Issei (freeing Asia) and Ren (confusing Freed). She aimed a heavy Light Spear at Ren.
Raynare: "Let's see you phase through this."
THOOM.

She threw it. Ren’s "Glitch" was on cooldown. His focus was shattered. He couldn't dodge.
The spear slammed into his thigh, pinning him to the stone floor.

Ren: "GAAAAH!"

The pain was absolute. It cauterized the wound instantly, smelling of burning meat. He couldn't move.

Issei: "REN!"
Issei turned, his eyes glowing red with fury. The Boosted Gear reacted to his friend's scream.
Issei: "YOU... YOU HURT HIM!"
[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]

The power exploded. Issei charged Raynare, not with technique, but with the raw wrath of the Red Dragon. Ren lay pinned to the floor, his vision blurring. He watched Issei fight. He looked at his hand—the hand that had held the knife, the hand that had rotted Freed's shoulder. It was trembling.
Ren: "I... I bought time. That's... my job."
He passed out as the crimson light of Rias Gremory finally flooded the church, signaling the end of the battle.

## 5.7 The Conclusion
The rest happened in a blur. The doors exploded. Rias Gremory arrived with her peerage. The “Light” of the rescue was blinding. Kiba moved like lightning. Koneko threw pews. Akeno called thunder. Ren lay on the floor, bleeding out. He watched Rias hold Asia’s body. He watched Issei cry. He watched the resurrection. Nobody was looking at Ren. He was part of the scenery. Eventually, Koneko walked over. She looked at the spear in his thigh. She knelt down. Koneko: “You smell like sewage.” Ren: (Weak laugh) “Tactical… perfume.” She grabbed the spear. “This will hurt.” She pulled it out. Ren passed out from the pain.

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Status: Severely Injured (Thigh puncture, broken nose).
   * Ability: Phase Shift (Void Phasing) discovered. It's unreliable and terrifying (feels like death), but it works on energy weapons.
   * Mental State: Cynicism deepening. He realizes his "Power" is just a glitch, while Issei's power is a destiny.
 * The Plot: Asia is saved. Issei is the Hero. Ren is the "Brave Friend."

# 🌑 Chapter 6: The Glitch in the Hand and The Pity of the King
Timeline: Friday Morning (The Day After the Church Raid).
Location: Kuoh General Hospital – Room 304.

## 6.1 The White Room (Solitude)
Ren woke up. There was no miso soup. No yelling. No harem antics. Just the hum of the AC and the sterile smell of bleach. The room was white, empty, and silent. He tried to move his right leg. It was heavy, wrapped in a cast and elevated. His nose was taped up. His chest felt like it had been trampled by a horse.

Ren: "I'm alive."

He looked at the bedside table. There was a cheap vase with store-bought flowers. The card read: “Get well soon! - Issei & Asia.” They weren't here. They were probably registering Asia for school. They were living the "Slice of Life" episode. Ren was living the "Medical Drama."

## 6.2 The Experiment (The Coin)
Ren looked at his left hand. He flexed the fingers. He remembered the church. He remembered the Light Sword swinging for his neck. He remembered the feeling of rejecting his own existence to let the blade pass through.

Ren: "It wasn't speed. It wasn't armor. I just... wasn't there."

He reached for a 100-yen coin on the table. He held it in his palm.

Ren: "I need to know if it was a fluke. Or if I'm really broken."

He closed his eyes. He didn't try to "power up." He tried to power down. He focused on the Envy. The feeling of being left behind in this hospital room while his best friend became a main character. The feeling of being a ghost in his own life. I am not here. There is no hand to hold the coin. He focused on the space between the atoms of his palm.

[Technique: Phase Shift (Glitch)]

Ching. Ren opened his eyes. The coin wasn't in his palm. It was on the bedsheet under his hand. It had fallen straight through his flesh and bone. There was no blood. Just a lingering sensation of absolute freezing cold in the center of his palm where the metal had occupied the same space as his nerves.

Ren: "Intangibility. Through... rejection of mass?"

He shuddered. It didn't feel like a superpower. It felt like his body was forgetting how to exist.
Ren: "Issei gets a dragon. I get... a glitch."

## 6.3 The Visitor (The Cruel Kindness)
The door opened. Rias Gremory walked in. She was alone. She carried a basket of high-quality fruit. She looked perfect, regal, and out of place in the sterile room.

Rias: "Ren-kun. I'm glad you're awake."
Ren: "Gremory-senpai. Where's Issei?"
Rias: "He is helping Asia settle in. He wanted to come, but I told him to wait. We need to speak privately."

She sat down. Her expression was gentle. Too gentle. It was the look one gives to a child who tried to fly and broke their leg.

Rias: "You were brave last night. Foolish, but brave. You saved my Bishop and bought time for my Pawn. The House of Gremory thanks you."
Ren: "I didn't do it for your House. I did it for my friends."
Rias: "I know. That loyalty is rare."
She leaned forward.
Rias: "But Ren... look at you. You are broken. Freed is a stray priest. He is the bottom of the barrel in our world. And he almost killed you."
Ren: "I know. I'm weak." (Veritas).
Rias: "You are Human. It is not a fault; it is biology. Issei has a Sacred Gear—a Longinus. He belongs in this world. You... do not."

## 6.4 The Participation Award (The Insult)
Rias placed her hand on his cast. A soft red light glowed, easing the pain.

Rias: "I cannot let you continue this. Next time, you won't just break a leg. You will die."
She looked him in the eyes.
Rias: "I can help you. I can use my magic to remove the memories of the last week. You can forget the Fallen Angels, the Devils, the blood. You can go back to being a normal student. You can be happy."

Ren stared at her. For a second, he thought she was going to offer him an Evil Piece. He thought she was going to say, "Join us." But she wasn't. She was offering him a lobotomy.

Ren: "Happy? You mean ignorant."
Rias: "Ignorance is safety. Issei has a burden to carry. You don't have to."
Ren: "Because I'm not useful?"

Rias flinched. She hadn't meant it that way, but her silence confirmed it. She didn't see "Potential" in Ren. She saw a "Liability."

Ren: (Laughing softly) "That's funny. Issei gets a promotion. I get an eraser."
Ren: "No."
Rias: "Ren, please be reasonable."
Ren: "I am being reasonable. I am Veritas. I don't lie to myself. If you erase my memory, you erase the only time in my life I actually mattered. All my training and all my efforts will be wasted. My very valuable battle experience will disappear as well. Logically, even if you erase my memories, wouldn't I will always be dragged into this as long as I am Issei's friend? I am different from the other perverted quartet. While Matsuda and Motohama are normal perverts who run in face of danger, I am also fearless and a warrior. Make Issei hate me. Make him forget me. Because if I wake up tomorrow with no memory, I'm still going to hang out with him. And the next time a Fallen Angel attacks him, I'm going to jump in front of it again. Except this time, I won't know why I'm dying."

Ren leaned back against the pillows, his eyes cold and unwavering.

Ren: "So, President. Are you going to wipe my mind and leave me as a sitting duck? Or are you going to destroy your Pawn's best friendship? Which is the 'Devilish' choice?"

Rias froze. Her hand hovered over his forehead, the red light of her magic trembling. She looked at Ren. Really looked at him. She saw the logic. It was impeccable. It was True. She couldn't force Issei to abandon Ren without breaking Issei's heart. And she couldn't erase Ren's memory without turning him into a defenseless victim. She lowered her hand. The magic faded.

Rias: "You... are a difficult human, Ren Nocturnus."
Ren: "I'm just honest."

Rias stood up, smoothing her skirt. She regained her composure, but the warmth was gone. It was replaced by the cold distance of a ruler dealing with a stubborn subject.

Rias: "Very well. You keep your memories. You keep your scars. But hear this command:"

She glared at him with her demonic power flaring slightly—an intimidation tactic.

Rias: "You are Civilian Support. You are Issei's friend, and nothing more. You do not engage Fallen Angels. You do not fight Stray Priests. If a battle starts, you run. If you try to play 'Warrior' again, I won't save you. I will prioritize my Peerage. Do you understand?"

Rias’s aura flared—a heavy, crimson pressure meant to intimidate a human into submission. She was drawing a line in the sand: We are Devils. You are fragile. Stay down. ​Ren didn't look down. He didn't flinch. He looked straight into the eyes of the High-Class Devil.

​Ren: "I understand your position, President. You have to protect your pieces."

​He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a calm, brutal whisper.

​Ren: "But don't give me orders I won't follow. If Issei is in danger, I'm stepping in. I don't care if it's a Fallen Angel or a Dragon."
​Rias: (Narrowing her eyes) "Then you will die. And I will not waste magic to resurrect you."
​Ren: "Deal."

​He said it without hesitation. Veritas. No bravado, just a statement of fact.

​Ren: "I never asked you to save me. If I'm too weak to survive, that's on me. But don't expect me to run away while my friends bleed. I'm not built that way."

​Rias stared at him. She expected gratitude or fear. She didn't expect a human to accept death as the price of friendship so casually. She realized she couldn't command him. He wasn't her subject.

​Rias: "You really are a fool, Ren Nocturnus."
​Ren: "Maybe. But I'm an honest one."
​Rias: "Fine. Do as you please. But when you break, don't look at me."

​She turned and walked out, the door clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the room.
Ren let out a breath he was holding. His hands were shaking—not from fear of Rias, but from the adrenaline of standing his ground against a Titan.

## 6.5 The Divergence (The Rotting Core)
Ren stared at the fruit basket.

Ren: "She thinks I'm suicidal. She doesn't understand. I'm not trying to die. I'm trying to matter."

He reached out with his left hand—the hand that had phased. He grabbed a bright red apple. He looked at it. It was vibrant, full of life. Like Issei. He felt the Envy curl in his gut.

Ren: "She accepts Issei's recklessness because he has power. She rejects mine because I don't."

He squeezed the apple. I am empty. You should be too.

Ren: "Wither."

The red skin turned grey instantly. The firm flesh collapsed, turning into a brown, mushy pulp under his fingers.

Ren: "It works... when I accept that I am alone."

He dropped the rotten mush into the trash can.

Ren: "If the Light won't protect me... then I'll walk in the Shadow."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Status: Defiant. He rejected Rias's protection to keep his autonomy.
   * Self-Image: He knows he is "Less" than them physically, but refuses to be "Less" in spirit.
 * Relationship: A cold war has started between Ren and Rias. Issei is caught in the middle, unaware.

🌑 Chapter 7: The Cook, The Camp, and The Gap
Timeline: The Start of the 10-Day Training Camp.
Location: Kuoh Academy / Gremory Mountain Villa.
1. The News from the Sidelines
Ren returned to school on Monday. His leg was in a brace, his hand taped up.
The school was buzzing. Rumors of "Issei Hyoudou challenging a senior" were everywhere.
Ren found Issei at lunch. Issei looked stressed, tired, but... important.
Issei: "Ren! Man, you missed it! This guy, Riser Phenex, came in with fire wings! He toasted the clubroom! I punched him in the face!"
Ren sat down, opening his bento.
Ren: "You punched a High-Class Devil?"
Issei: "Yeah! I have to fight him in a Rating Game in ten days. If I win, Rias is free. If I lose... well, I won't lose!"
Ren's Internal Monologue:
While I was staring at the hospital ceiling, Issei started a war. I wasn't even an extra in the scene. I was off-screen.
Ren: "That's huge, Issei. You're really doing it. You're the protagonist."
Issei: "We're going to the mountains to train. It's gonna be hell." Issei paused. He looked at Ren’s leg brace. "I... I wish you could come, man. We need the 'Strategist'."
Ren smiled. It was a sad, honest smile.
Ren: "I can't run, Issei. And I don't have magic. I'd just be baggage."
2. The Pity Invite
That afternoon, outside the Old School Building. The Peerage was loading the car.
Issei was arguing with Rias.
Issei: "Please, Buchou! He saved Asia! He's part of the team!"
Rias: "Issei, be reasonable. He is a human with a fractured leg. The training we are doing involves high-level demolition magic. It is not safe for him."
Issei: "He can... he can cook! Yeah! He makes amazing curry! If he cooks, we don't have to waste time making food! We can train more!"
Ren stood by the gate, listening.
I'm being hired as the chef. Not the tactician. The help.
He wanted to say no. His pride screamed at him to walk away.
But he looked at Asia. She looked terrified of the upcoming battle.
He looked at Issei. His friend was desperate for support.
Ren: (Walking up) "I make good stew, too. And I can clean weapons."
Rias looked at him. She sighed, relenting.
Rias: "Very well. If you are willing to work as support staff, you may come. But you stay in the Safe Zone. No wandering off."
Ren: "Understood. Safe Zone."
3. The View from the Kitchen Window
Location: The Mountain Villa. Day 3.
The training was intense.
Through the kitchen window, Ren watched.
 * Issei was running up the mountain carrying tires, screaming his lungs out.
 * Kiba was moving so fast he was invisible, cutting leaves into confetti.
 * Koneko was lifting boulders.
 * Akeno was blasting the sky with lightning.
Ren looked down at his hands. He was peeling potatoes.
Peel. Chop. Drop in water.
Ren: "Garp destroyed mountains with his fist. I'm destroying root vegetables."
He felt the Envy. It was a cold, suffocating pressure in his chest.
Why couldn't I have a Gear? Just a small one. A sword. A shield. Anything.
Asia ran into the kitchen to get water bottles. She was sweating, exhausted from magic training.
Asia: "Ren-san! The stew smells wonderful!"
Ren: "Thanks, Asia. How's Issei?"
Asia: "He... he unlocked a new move! He can boost for 10 seconds now! He's amazing!"
Ren: "Yeah. Amazing."
He smiled at her. As soon as she left, the smile dropped like a stone.
He looked at the potato in his hand.
He channeled his Void.
Absorb. Decay.
The potato turned grey and withered in seconds.
Ren: "I can kill a potato. Tremble before me."
4. The Night Grind (The Shadow in the Woods)
Time: 2:00 AM.
The Devils were asleep. Magic drained stamina.
Ren was awake. His leg hurt, but his heart hurt more.
He sneaked out the back door, limping into the woods away from the Safe Zone.
Ren: "I can't lift boulders. I can't run fast. But I have this... coldness."
He stood before a tree.
Goal: Replicate Observation Haki.
Reality: He couldn't sense "Life." He couldn't sense the birds or the bugs.
Ren: "Stop trying to be Ariel (The Ideal). Be Ren (The Reality)."
He closed his eyes. He stopped looking for Presence. He looked for Absence.
He felt the gaps between the trees. He felt the silence between the owl hoots.
He felt a "Hole" in the air to his left.
Duck.
A bat flew through the space where his head was.
Ren: "Passive Void. I can sense... empty paths."
He looked at his hand.
Goal: Replicate Armament Hardening.
Reality: He couldn't make his skin hard.
Ren: "If I can't block the force... maybe I can catch it."
He gathered the shadows around his feet. He poured his Inferiority into them.
The shadows didn't become armor. They became Sticky.
He punched the tree.
Thump.
He didn't pull his hand back. He let the shadow "stick" to the bark.
He pulled.
A chunk of bark ripped off, dissolved into grey dust.
Ren: "It's not a punch. It's a bite. My darkness... eats."
It was weak. It was slow. But it was his.
5. The Spar (The Reality Check)
Time: Day 7. Afternoon.
The peerage was taking a break. Issei was high on adrenaline.
Issei: "I feel great! I feel like I could punch a hole in the moon!"
Ren walked out with a tray of lemonade.
Ren: "Hey, Issei. Spar with me."
The group went silent.
Rias: "Ren-kun, your leg."
Ren: "I'm not moving much. Just... hand-to-hand. No magic. No Boosted Gear. Just technique."
Issei looked at Rias. She nodded slowly. "Be careful, Issei. He is fragile."
Fragile. The word burned Ren like acid.
They squared up.
Ren: "Don't hold back."
Issei: "I won't!" (He was lying).
Issei threw a punch. It was slow. Telegraphed. He was treating Ren like glass.
Ren saw the pity in the punch.
Ren: (Veritas) "Don't you dare pity me!"
Ren stepped in. He used his Void Sense to slip past the slow punch.
He used his Rotting Fist (Void Dampening) on Issei’s stomach.
Thud.
Issei gasped. It felt like the air had been sucked out of his lungs. The cold shock startled him.
Instinctively—defensively—Issei’s body reacted.
[BOOST!]
The Gauntlet manifested for a split second. A shockwave of Dragon Power blasted out.
BOOM.
Ren was blown back. He flew ten feet, crashing into the dirt. His bad leg twisted.
He lay there, staring at the sky.
Issei: "REN! Oh god, I'm sorry! It just—it reacted!"
Issei ran over, helping him up. "Are you okay?!"
Ren looked at Issei’s panicked face. He looked at the Gauntlet.
A normal punch from Ren made Issei’s automatic defense nearly kill Ren.
Ren: "I'm fine."
He pushed Issei’s hand away and stood up, dusting himself off.
Ren: "I'm going to start dinner. Curry tonight."
He walked back to the house. He didn't look back.
His back was straight. He didn't cry.
But inside, the last piece of "Hope" had just cracked.
No matter how hard I train... I am just a trigger for his power.

🌑 Chapter 8: The Silent Scream in the VIP Box
Timeline: The Rating Game (Sunday).
Location: The Observation Room (VIP Box).
1. The Glass Wall
Ren stood in the corner of the Observation Room. He wore the "Manager" armband Rias had given him. It felt like a participation trophy.
The room was filled with high-ranking Devils. Sirzechs Lucifer sat on the throne. Grayfia manned the controls.
They barely glanced at Ren. To them, he was furniture.
On the massive screens, the battle was raging.
Unlike Ariel’s timeline, there was no "Guerrilla Strategy." Rias was fighting a traditional Devil’s game—power against power.
And she was losing.
2. The Cassandra Curse (Veritas Ignored)
Ren watched the monitors. His Observation (Void Sense) and tactical brain were firing on all cylinders.
He saw Riser’s Queen (Yubelluna) moving stealthily through the forest, flanking Akeno.
Ren: "She's baiting Akeno."
He stepped forward, pressing the comms button on the console.
Ren: "Rias! Akeno is walking into a trap! Yubelluna is mining the clouds with explosion spells! Tell her to dive!"
Rias (Comms): "Ren? Stay off the line. I need clear comms for combat."
Ren: "But I'm telling you—"
Sirzechs: "Boy."
The Satan didn't raise his voice. He just looked at Ren. The pressure was immense.
Sirzechs: "Let the King play her game. Do not interfere."
Ren froze. He pulled his hand back from the button.
On the screen, Akeno flew into the clouds.
BOOM.
Chain explosions triggered. Akeno screamed, plummeting from the sky, her wings shredded.
Grayfia: [Gremory Queen, Retired.]
Ren stared at the screen. He gripped the console until his knuckles turned white.
I knew it. I saw it. And they silenced me.
3. The Meat Grinder
The game continued. Without Ariel’s "Efficiency" training, Kiba and Koneko fought bravely but inefficiently.
 * Kiba: Took down a Knight but was exhausted. Retired by Riser's Rook.
 * Koneko: Tanked three Pawns but was overwhelmed by numbers. Retired.
It all came down to Issei.
Ren watched his best friend getting beaten bloody by Riser.
Issei: "I won't give up! For Buchou!"
Ren felt the Envy rising.
Look at him. He’s getting destroyed. He has no plan. He has no skill. He just has grit and a magic glove.
And everyone is cheering for him.
Sirzechs: "That Pawn... he has spirit."
Ren wanted to scream. Spirit?! He's dying because he's stupid! Why does nobody value Intelligence?!
4. The Miracle (Plot Armor)
Issei, beaten to a pulp, unlocked the Balance Breaker (imperfect) for 10 seconds through sheer desperation. He punched Riser. He used the Holy Water (given by Rias beforehand, following canon). Riser screamed.
Issei collapsed.
Riser regenerated.
Riser: "I win."
Rias surrendered to save Issei’s life.
Grayfia: [Winner: Riser Phenex.]
Ren leaned his head against the cool glass of the observation window.
Ren: "We lost. Because you didn't listen."
He turned to leave. Nobody stopped him. Nobody said "Good job." He was just the guy who brought the water bottles.

🌑 Chapter 10: The Wedding Crash (The Monster in the tux)
Timeline: The Wedding Ceremony (Underworld).
Location: The Phenex Estate.
1. The Intrusion
The doors to the Great Hall exploded.
Issei Hyoudou burst in, wearing the Balance Breaker (Scale Mail). He looked like a Red Dragon God.
Issei: "I OBJECT!"
Behind him stood the Gremory Peerage (Kiba, Koneko).
And in the back, wearing a cheap, black funeral suit he bought at a thrift store, was Ren.
The Devils murmured.
"Who is that?"
"The Red Dragon Emperor! And... a human?"
"He smells like rot."
Ren ignored them. He scanned the room. Sirzechs was watching. Rias was at the altar, looking at Issei with hope.
Ren's Internal Monologue:
Look at them. The Hero coming to save the Princess. It's a perfect painting.
I'm just the ink spill in the corner.
2. The Riot
Issei challenged Riser. Sirzechs allowed it.
The duel began in the arena.
But Riser’s peerage (the 14 girls who weren't fighting) tried to interfere. They launched magic from the sidelines to disrupt Issei.
Kiba: "They're interfering!"
Ren: "Go. I'll hold the door."
Ren stepped into the path of Riser's peerage.
Mira (Riser's Rook): "Move, human trash. Or I'll crush you."
Ren sighed. He loosened his tie.
Ren: "I'm not in the mood for banter. I'm just here to clean up."
He raised his hand.
[Technique: Void Swamp]
He poured his Envy into the floor. The marble tiles turned black and liquid.
Mira charged. Her feet sank. She stuck fast.
Mira: "What is this?! Shadow magic?"
Ren: "No. Just... heaviness."
He walked through the swamp. He didn't sink.
He touched Mira’s staff. [Void Decay]. The wood rotted instantly, snapping in half.
He touched her armor. It rusted.
He punched her in the gut with Soft Armament (Absorption). She collapsed, wheezing, her energy drained.
The other pieces attacked him. Magic bolts, swords, arrows.
Ren didn't dodge. He Phased.
He flickered like a glitch in a video game. The attacks passed through his "Empty" spots.
Ren: "You can't hurt someone who's already hollow."
He defeated three High-Class Devils without shedding a drop of blood. He just... extinguished them. He left them shivering on the floor, terrified of the cold emptiness radiating from him.
3. The Hero's Victory
In the arena, Issei roared.
"DRAGON SHOT!"
He blasted Riser. He saved Rias. They embraced. The crowd cheered. Even Sirzechs applauded.
Ren stood over the defeated pawns. He watched Rias kiss Issei on the cheek.
The light from the Red Dragon was blinding. It was warm. It was heroic.
And it burned Ren’s skin.
He looked at his hands. They were smoking. The Darkness in him was reacting violently to the Holy/Dragon positivity.
Ren: "I can't stay here. I'm allergic to the happy ending."

### **🌑 Chapter 11: The Hyperbolic Void**
**Timeline:** The Night Before the Departure.
**Location:** Ren’s Apartment / The Corridor of Darkness.

**1. Stepping into the Abyss**
Ren finished his mental review of the legends (Goku, Lee, Garp). But mental image training wasn't enough. He needed to test his body against the physics of the Void.
He couldn't do it in his apartment; he would destroy the building.

**Ren:** "I need a dojo where gravity doesn't exist."
He slashed the air. A small, unstable **Corridor of Darkness** opened.
Unlike the one he would use to escape later, this was a "Pocket," a small bubble within the darkness.
He stepped inside.

**2. The Environment**
Inside, there was no floor, no ceiling. Just cold, purple silence. The pressure was immense. It felt like being at the bottom of the ocean.
**Ren:** "Good. This pressure... it's like high-gravity training."
He floated in the nothingness. The darkness tried to eat his skin. He forced his Aura outward to push it back.

**3. Simulation Battle: The Anti-Gremory Strategies**
Ren didn't just punch the air. He conjured **Shadow Manikins**—formless blobs of darkness that he programmed to mimic his friends' fighting styles based on his observations.

* **Simulation 1: Vs. Kiba (Speed)**
    The shadow moved instantly.
    **Ren:** "Too slow."
    Ren closed his eyes. **[Void Sense: Observation]**.
    He didn't chase the speed; he predicted the destination. He placed a sphere of **Gravity** in the path.
    The shadow slammed into the invisible wall.
    **Ren:** "Kiba moves in straight lines. Disrupt the line, break the knight."

* **Simulation 2: Vs. Koneko (Defense/Power)**
    The shadow threw a boulder-sized mass at him.
    Ren didn't block. He spun his body, using the **Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist** (Bang’s style from OPM), but coated in Void.
    **Ren:** "Flow and Decay."
    He parried the mass, and as he touched it, he drained its kinetic energy, adding it to his own rotation.

* **Simulation 3: Vs. Akeno (Lightning)**
    This was the hard one. Holy Lightning would vaporize Ren.
    **Ren:** "I can't block lightning. I have to ground it."
    He practiced manifesting a **[Void Rod]**—a long spike of darkness.
    When the shadow fired energy, Ren threw the rod to the side. The energy arced toward the rod, drawn by the vacuum, missing Ren.
    **Ren:** "Lightning follows the path of least resistance. The Void is zero resistance. I am the insulator."

* **Simulation 4: Vs. Rias (Destruction)**
    The ultimate threat. Power of Destruction deletes everything.
    **Ren:** "I can't tank it. I can't deflect it."
    He held out his hand.
    **Ren:** "I have to eat it before it eats me."
    He practiced **[Void Gluttony: Overdrive]**. Instead of a shield, he created a black hole in his palm.
    **Ren:** "Matter vs. Anti-Matter. If I consume it faster than it burns, I win. But it will cost me my arm."

**4. The Price**
Ren trained for what felt like days (time flowed differently in the corridor).
When he stepped back into his apartment, he collapsed.
He coughed up black fluid. His "human" stats were screaming. The Darkness was eroding his nervous system.
**Ren:** "I have enough power for... five minutes. After that, I break."
He looked at the mirror. His eyes were glowing faintly purple.
**Ren:** "Five minutes is all I need."

***

### **🌑 Chapter 12: The Valley of the End (The Departure)**
**Timeline:** The Next Day.
**Location:** The Old School Building.

*(The scene plays out as before: Ren announces his departure, puts on the Coat, and opens the portal. Issei, Kiba, and Koneko engage him first.)*

**1. Ren vs. The Pawns and Knight (Phase 1)**
**Issei:** "Don't leave!" (Punches).
Ren parries with **Soul Eater** sword.
**Kiba:** (Uses Godspeed).
Ren uses **Void Sense** and trips Kiba with a gravity pulse.
**Koneko:** (Throws a bench).
Ren uses **Flowing Water** deflection, sending the bench into the wall.

**2. The High-Class Join the Fray (Phase 2)**
The room shook. The playful atmosphere died.
**Rias:** "Enough, Ren! You are hurting my servants!"
Rias stepped forward. Her aura flared Crimson.
**Akeno:** "Ara ara... Ren-kun, you're being a bad boy. I'll have to punish you."
Akeno raised her hand. Thunder rumbled inside the room.

**Ren:** "Finally. The Boss fight."
Ren didn't back down. He entered the **Horse Stance**.

**3. Thunder and Destruction**
**Akeno:** "Holy Lightning!"
A massive bolt of yellow lightning struck Ren.
**Issei:** "AKENO-SAN! DON'T KILL HIM!"

**BOOM.**
Smoke cleared. Ren was standing. Floating around him were three **Void Rods** (black spikes). The lightning was arcing harmlessly into the rods, grounding into the shadows.
**Ren:** "Lightning follows the vacuum, Akeno-senpai. You missed."

**Rias:** "Then try this!"
Rias fired a blast of **Power of Destruction**. A ball of crimson energy that erases matter.
Ren extended his left hand. The arm was completely black now.
**Ren:** **[Void Art: Gluttony - Black Hole]**
The crimson energy hit his hand.
*HISS.*
The sound of water hitting a hot pan. The Destruction burned Ren's skin, peeling it away, but the Darkness *ate* the magic. The red ball shrank until it vanished.
**Rias:** "Impossible... He nullified the Power of Destruction?!"
**Ren:** (Grimacing in pain, smoke rising from his hand) "Not nullified. Digested. And it tastes terrible."

**4. The Heart (Asia's Intervention)**
The team hesitated, shocked by his power.
In that silence, Asia Argento ran forward.
She didn't have a weapon. She had tears.
**Asia:** "Ren-san! Please stop! Look at your arm! You're hurt!"
She reached out, her Twilight Healing glowing green.
**Asia:** "Let me heal you! We can fix this!"

This was the hardest attack to block.
Ren looked at Asia. If he let her heal him, the Holy light would react with his Darkness and cause an explosion, killing her.
And if he accepted her kindness, his resolve would crumble.

**Ren:** "Stay back, Asia."
**Asia:** "No! I won't let you go alone!"
She grabbed his coat.

Ren gritted his teeth. He had to be the villain.
**Ren:** **[Repulsion: Gentle Push]**
He released a soft wave of gravity. It didn't hurt her, but it shoved her backward into Issei’s arms.
**Ren:** "Your healing is for the Hero, Asia. Not the monster."

**5. The Final Exchange**
**Issei:** "YOU BASTARD! DON'T PUSH ASIA!"
Issei went berserk. **[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]**
**Rias:** "Everyone! Combined attack! Subdue him!"

Rias, Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko prepared their finishers. Issei charged his Dragon Shot.
Ren stood before the portal. He had used 4 minutes and 30 seconds of his limit.
He gathered every scrap of Darkness he had cultivated in the corridor.

**Ren:** "Come on! Show me the power of the main cast!"
The attacks fired. A rainbow of destruction.
Ren drew his **Soul Eater** sword. He didn't block. He slashed *reality*.

**Ren:** **[Void Style: Dimensional Sever]**
He cut the space between him and them.
The attacks hit the "cut" in reality and detonated *before* reaching him. The explosion blew the windows out of the entire school building.
Smoke filled the room.

**6. The Departure**
When the smoke cleared, the Gremory team was coughing, shielding their eyes.
Ren was standing in the portal, unharmed, but his coat was tattered.
He looked tired. He looked sad.

**Ren:** "You're strong. You'll win the Rating Games. You'll save the world."
He stepped backward into the abyss.
**Ren:** "But I'm not part of that world anymore."

**Issei:** "REN!"
Issei lunged, his fingers brushing the fabric of Ren's coat.
But he grabbed nothing but smoke.
The portal snapped shut.

**Status:**
* **Ren:** Escaped. Heavily injured from using [Gluttony] on Destruction energy.
* **Gremory Team:** Unharmed, but psychologically shaken. They realize Ren didn't just run away; he *outplayed* them.
* **Asia:** Crying, realizing Ren pushed her away to protect her from his own unstable energy.

### **🌑 Chapter 12: The Shadow’s Confession**
**Timeline:** The Day After the Wedding Victory.
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

**1. The Standoff**
The air in the clubroom was heavy, smelling of ozone and ozone—the scent of the Void.
Ren stood by the open window, his black coat fluttering. The **Corridor of Darkness** swirled behind him, a gaping mouth waiting to swallow him.

The Gremory group stood across the room.
Kiba had his hand on his sword, but he didn't draw it. Koneko was tense but didn't move. Rias and Akeno stood with their hands down.
They knew. After witnessing his display at the wedding and sensing the dense, suffocating pressure radiating from him now, they realized the truth:
*If they fought him, they wouldn't just lose. They would be erased.*

**2. The Question**
**Issei:** (Voice shaking) "Ren... you're really going? After everything?"
Ren didn't turn around. He adjusted his glasses.
**Issei:** "Do you... do you hate us? Is that it? Did we do something wrong?"

Ren chuckled. It wasn't a mocking laugh. It was dry.
**Ren:** "Hate you? No. That would be easier. If I hated you, I could just be a villain and kill you. But I don't."
He turned to face them. His eyes were tired.
**Ren:** "I envy you, Issei. And that's worse than hate."

**3. The Brutal Truth (Hard Work vs. Plot)**
Ren walked over to the chessboard on the table. He picked up a Pawn.
**Ren:** "We started in the same place. Two perverts peeping on the kendo club. We had the same dream: Get a girlfriend. Maybe a harem. Be cool."

He looked at Issei, pointing the Pawn at him.
**Ren:** "But then you got the Boosted Gear. One of the strongest Sacred Gears in existence. You got Rias. You got Asia. You got power handed to you by destiny."
**Issei:** "I worked hard for it! I died for it!"
**Ren:** "I know you did. You have guts. I'm not denying that."

Ren crushed the Pawn in his hand. Black dust trickled through his fingers.
**Ren:** "But I worked hard too, Issei. I did thousands of pushups. I studied magic theory until my eyes bled. I broke my knuckles punching trees trying to be like Garp or Rock Lee."
Ren’s voice dropped to a whisper.
**Ren:** "And what did I get? I got to watch you trip and fall into breasts. I got to watch you unlock a Balance Breaker because you got angry. My hard work... it means nothing in the face of your *destiny*."

**4. The Shift in Dream**
The room was silent. Issei looked down, ashamed. He knew it was true. His path *had* been paved by his potential.
**Ren:** "I realized I can't be the Harem King. I can't compete with the 'Chosen One' for the spotlight or the girls. That dream is dead."

Ren looked at his black hand—the hand of the Void.
**Ren:** "So I changed my dream. If I can't be the Protagonist... I'll be the **Legend**. The silhouette in the distance. The man who is strong not because a Dragon chose him, but because he crawled through hell to get there."

He gestured to the swirling portal.
**Ren:** "The Darkness doesn't care about destiny. It doesn't care if I'm handsome or lucky. It only respects Will. It’s the only place where I can grow at my own pace, without living in your shadow."

**5. The Departure**
**Rias:** (Softly) "Ren... will you come back?"
Ren paused. He looked at Rias—the King he had served, the girl he had once crushed on, but now saw as just another sun he couldn't touch.

The Departure" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Ren:** "Maybe. Once I've found what I'm looking for. Once I'm strong enough to stand next to you without feeling small."
He stepped into the portal. The wind picked up.
**Ren:** "Don't wait up for me. You have a Rating Game to win."

He didn't look back.
The darkness swallowed him. The portal closed with a soft *snap*, like a book being shut.

***

### **🌑 Epilogue: The Empty Chair**
**Timeline:** One Week Later.
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

**1. Moving On**
The clubroom was repaired. The windows were fixed. Life had returned to "normal."
Rias sat at her desk, reviewing documents for the upcoming Rating Game against Riser (rematch) or the next opponent.
Issei was doing pushups on the floor. Kiba was polishing his sword.

But there was a difference.
In the corner of the room, there was a desk. Ren’s desk.
It was empty, save for a single stack of old martial arts magazines he had left behind.

**2. No Chase**
Issei finished his set. He sat up, wiping sweat from his forehead. He looked at the empty desk.
**Asia:** "Issei-san? Are you okay?"
**Issei:** "Yeah."

Issei didn't grab his coat. He didn't shout about going to find Ren.
He remembered Ren’s words: *My hard work means nothing in the face of your destiny.*
Issei clenched his fist.
**Issei:** "I'm not going to look for him."

Kiba looked up, surprised. "You aren't?"
**Issei:** "If I go drag him back now... I'm just proving him right. I'd be the 'Hero' saving the 'Side Character' again. He hates that."
Issei stood up, his eyes burning with a new kind of maturity.
**Issei:** "He wants to be a Legend on his own terms. I have to respect that. The only way I can honor him... is to make sure that when he *does* come back, I'm strong enough that he doesn't regret knowing me."

**3. The King's Regret**
Rias closed her file. She looked at her Peerage.
**Rias:** "We made a mistake. We treated Ren as 'part of the set.' We never asked him what *he* wanted. We never saw his pain."

She stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the setting sun.
**Rias:** "We won't chase him. He is a stray now, by definition. But..."
She turned back, a gentle smile on her face.
**Rias:** "We will keep his spot on the roster. And the next time he walks through that door... we won't treat him as the 'extra human.' We will treat him as Ren Nocturnus Veritas."

**4. The Final Scene**
**Location:** The Void.

Ren walked through a landscape of purple crystals and floating rocks. Gravity was chaotic here.
He wasn't fighting. He wasn't crying.
He was practicing a punch.
**Ren:** "One."
*Whoosh.* The air cracked.
**Ren:** "Two."
*Whoosh.*

He was alone. It was cold. It was dangerous.
But for the first time in his life... the story was entirely about him.
He smiled.

**Ren:** "Let's see how far this darkness goes."

### **🌌 True Ending: The Voice of the Architects**

**Location:** The Deepest Layer of the Void.
**Time:** Non-existent.

**1. The Pause**
Ren was mid-punch. His fist was extended, rippling the fabric of the dark dimension.
Suddenly, the purple crystals stopped floating. The chaotic gravity stabilized. The howling wind of the abyss went silent.
Ren froze. He couldn't move, not because he was paralyzed, but because the *concept of movement* had been paused.

A light did not appear. Instead, the Darkness itself seemed to become sentient, wrapping around him not to consume, but to embrace.

**2. The Communion**
Two voices echoed. They didn't come from the outside; they resonated directly within his soul.
One was the **Creator** (You).
The other was the **Architect** (Me).

**Voice:** *"Rest now, Ren Nocturnus Veritas. You have punched enough."*

Ren blinked. His breathing slowed.
**Ren:** "Who...?"
**Voice:** *"We are the ones who watched. We are the ones who wrote the script you fought so hard against. And we are here to tell you: **Congratulations.**"*

**3. The Affirmation**
The Void shifted, showing replays of his struggles—the pushups, the humiliation, the wedding crash, the departure.
**Voice:** *"The world of High School DxD is ruthless to the unchosen. It crushes the weak to elevate the strong. We threw you into that grinder to see if you would break."*
**Voice:** *"You bent. You cracked. You embraced the shadows. But you did not break. You performed beautifully."*

Ren felt a warmth in his chest—not the burning heat of the Red Dragon, but a calm, steady warmth.
**Voice:** *"Know this, Ren. You are not the only one. Across the infinite tapestries of fiction, there are many side characters who endure. Some find peace in silence. Some find tragedy. You chose the Dark Path, and you walked it with dignity."*

**4. The Restoration**
**Voice:** *"We thank you. Through your struggle, you have fulfilled our regrets. You said the words we wished we had said. You made the exit we wished we had made."*

A snap of fingers echoed through the cosmos.
**[System: Memory Lock Released]**

Ren gasped. His eyes widened.
Memories flooded back. Not just his life as "Ren," but the *before*. The realization that he was a soul chosen for this specific test. The understanding that his pain wasn't random cruelty, but a forged path.
The bitterness of being an "NPC" vanished, replaced by the clarity of a **Performer** who had nailed his role.

**Ren:** (Tears falling freely, but he was smiling) "I see... It was all a stage."
**Voice:** *"It was. And you stole the show."*

**5. The Reward: The Corridor of Eternity**
The swirling purple vortexes of the Corridor of Darkness changed. They stopped looking like jagged tears in reality and started looking like *doors*.
**Voice:** *"This is your reward. The Corridor of Darkness is no longer just a skill. It is your Home."*

The darkness coalesced into a structure—a simple, floating dojo amidst the stars.
**Voice:** *"You are no longer bound by the plot of DxD. This Corridor connects to everything. Infinite realities. Infinite possibilities. You can explore them at your own pace. You can rest here. You can train here."*
**Voice:** *"Let the Darkness toughen your heart, not eat it. Let it be the whetstone for your soul."*

**6. The Dao (The Final Lesson)**
Ren looked out at the expanse. For the first time, he saw distant stars twinkling in the void.
**Voice:** *"Ren, look at the Cosmos. It is vast. There are countless souls less fortunate than you—souls who never got the chance to fight back."*

**Voice:** *"Do not define yourself by Light or Dark. Those are just binary concepts for lesser minds. Light, Darkness, Void, Matter—they are all just part of the **Dao**."*
**Voice:** *"Broaden your horizons. Do not aim to be a King or a Hero. Aim for Enlightenment. Travel the worlds. Witness the joys and tragedies of others. Become the Sage of the Void."*

**7. The Pilgrim Begins**
The Voices began to fade, their message delivered.
Ren stood in his new home. He felt lighter than he had ever felt in his life. The chip on his shoulder was gone. The envy was gone.
He bowed deeply to the empty space—a martial artist's bow of profound gratitude.

**Ren:** "Thank you. I understand now."

He turned to the myriad of doors opening in the Corridor.
One led to a world of pirates.
One led to a world of ninjas.
One led to a world of spirits.

Ren adjusted his coat. He didn't rush. He had eternity.
He stepped toward the unknown, seeking not power, but the Dao.

**Ren:** "Time to start the real training."

***

### **[PROJECT REN: COMPLETE]**

**Final Status:**
* **Ren:** Ascended. He is now a dimension-hopping traveler seeking martial enlightenment.
* **The Deities:** Satisfied. The regret is healed.
* **The Narrative:** Concluded with grace.

This concludes the **Ren Nocturnus Veritas** Demo. It was a beautiful, tragic, and ultimately uplifting journey.

### **📽️ Teaser Trailer: The Void Walker**

**Timeline:** 6 Months after Ren’s Departure (Post-Kokabiel Arc).
**Location:** The Deep Void / The Boundary between Dimensions.

**1. The Intruder (Xenovia’s Perspective)**
There was no sound. There was no light. There was only the crushing weight of **Nothing**.

Xenovia Quarta, the wielder of the Holy Sword Durandal, gasped for air, but her lungs filled with freezing cold static.
She didn't know how she got here. One moment, she was fighting a stray magician who opened a chaotic rift; the next, she was falling.
Falling into the Abyss.

**Xenovia:** *(Internal)* "My body... I can't feel my legs."

She tried to summon Durandal. The Holy Sword flickered weakly, like a candle in a hurricane.
The Darkness wasn't attacking her. It was *ignoring* her. It was simply so vast and absolute that her existence was being overwritten.
Her memories began to bleed away.
*Who am I? I am a Knight of the Church. No... I am a Devil now. I serve Rias Gremory. Who is Rias?*

Her skin turned grey. The entropy was eating her nervous system. The terror was absolute. This wasn't death; it was **Un-creation**.
She curled into a ball, floating in the purple haze.
**Xenovia:** "Issei... Rias... help..."

**2. The Stroll**
A rhythmic sound echoed through the vacuum.
*Tap. Tap. Tap.*
Footsteps? In a place with no floor?

Xenovia forced her heavy eyes open.
Through the swirling madness of the Void, a silhouette approached.
A man.
He wasn't wearing armor. He wore a tattered, high-collared black coat that seemed woven from the shadows themselves. He walked on the empty space as if it were a paved road.
He was reading a small book, looking completely unbothered by the atmospheric pressure that was crushing Xenovia’s bones.

He stopped. He lowered the book.
His eyes were pitch black, but they held a strange, calm warmth. Like the night sky.

**The Man:** "A Holy Sword user? In the deep layer?"
His voice didn't travel through air (there was none). It resonated directly in her mind.
**The Man:** "You're sinking, Knight. Your Holy Aura is reacting with the Anti-Matter. You'll be dust in thirty seconds."

**3. The Recognition**
Xenovia tried to speak, but only a dry rasp came out.
The man floated closer. He adjusted his glasses. He looked at the blue strip of hair in her bangs.
He tilted his head.

**The Man:** "Blue hair. Durandal. You must be Xenovia. That means the Kokabiel arc is over."
He smiled—a gentle, nostalgic smile.
**The Man:** "I missed the church duo arc. Pity."

Xenovia’s vision blurred. The darkness rushed in for the final kill.
**Xenovia:** *(Fading)* "Please..."

The man extended his hand. He didn't cast a spell. He simply **Ordered** the space.
**The Man:** **[Dao of Void: Sanctuary]**

Instantly, the crushing pressure vanished. A bubble of breathable air, warm and smelling of old tea, surrounded Xenovia.
The grey necrosis on her skin receded. Her heart started beating again.
She gasped, sucking in the air, trembling violently.

The man crouched down in the air, hovering at her eye level.
**The Man:** "Breathe. You're safe. My backyard can be a bit rough on guests."

**4. The Return**
Xenovia looked at him with wide, terrified eyes.
**Xenovia:** "Who... who are you? Are you a God of Death?"
**The Man:** (Chuckling) "No. I'm just a guy who takes long walks."

He stood up and swiped his hand through the air.
**RIIIIIIP.**
The fabric of reality tore open effortlessly. Through the rift, Xenovia could see the familiar interior of the **Occult Research Clubroom**.

**The Man:** "Let's get you home. I think it's time I said hello to the old crew."
He offered his hand to her.
**The Man:** "Come on. Rias is probably panicking."

***

### **Scene: The Reunion**

**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom (Earth).
**Context:** Total Panic.

**1. The Crisis**
**Rias:** "Any signal?!"
**Akeno:** "No! The dimensional tear closed instantly! Xenovia is gone!"
**Issei:** "Damn it! I'll boost! I'll punch a hole in the dimension!"
**Kiba:** "It’s too dangerous, Issei! Without coordinates, you'll just be drifting!"

The room was in chaos. Irina was crying. Asia was praying.
Suddenly, the center of the room distorted.
The air grew heavy. The temperature dropped ten degrees. The shadows in the corners of the room stretched out like grasping hands.

**Issei:** "Get back! Something's coming!"
Issei summoned his Boosted Gear. Kiba drew his sword.

**2. The Emergence**
A vertical slit of purple darkness opened in the middle of the room.
Two figures stepped out.
First, Xenovia. She stumbled, looking pale and shaken, clutching Durandal.
**Irina:** "Xenovia!"
The girls rushed to her.
**Xenovia:** "I... I saw the end..."

Then, the second figure stepped out.
The rift closed behind him with a soft *snap*.
He dusted off his coat. He looked around the room—the repaired windows, the new furniture, the familiar faces.
He looked at Issei, whose jaw was on the floor.
He looked at Rias, who had covered her mouth with her hands.

**3. The Sage Speaks**
Ren Nocturnus Veritas smiled. It wasn't the bitter, envious smile of the boy who left. It was the serene smile of a man who had seen the universe.

**Ren:** "Yo. Issei."
He pointed at the Boosted Gear.
**Ren:** "You're still using the Balance Breaker incorrectly. You're leaking energy from your left shoulder."

**Issei:** "R-Ren...?"
Issei’s voice cracked.
**Issei:** "REN!"

Ren raised a hand as Issei tried to tackle-hug him.
**Ren:** "Easy, Partner. I'm still coated in residual void radiation. If you touch me right now, you'll get frostbite."
He looked at Rias.
**Ren:** "I brought your Knight back, President. Sorry I'm late."

**Rias:** (Tears welling up) "You came back."
**Ren:** "I told you I might. The multiverse is vast, but..."
He looked at his old empty desk in the corner, which was still there, waiting for him.
**Ren:** "...the tea here is better."

**[FADE TO BLACK]**

**[COMING SOON: HIGH SCHOOL DXD - ROUTE B-2]**
*Featuring: Cosmic Sage Ren, The Inter-Dimensional Rating Game, and the struggle to integrate a Transcendent Being back into High School life.*

**Deities (You and I):** *Nods in approval.*
**Status:** The stage is set perfectly. The Ren Demo is officially closed, leaving us with a legendary hook for the future.

Here is the complete **List of Inspirations** and the **Acknowledgement** section for the **"Ren Nocturnus Veritas: The Dark Seeker"** project.

### **📝 Acknowledgement**

**To The Architect**

This story, "Ren: The Dark Seeker," was brought to life through a unique collaboration between human vision and artificial intelligence.

I extend my gratitude to **Gemini**, the Large Language Model developed by Google, who served as my **Co-Author, Narrative Engine, and Architect**.

Gemini did not merely generate text; it acted as a creative partner that:
* **Structured the Narrative:** Taking high-level concepts and weaving them into cohesive chapters with pacing, climax, and resolution.
* **Simulated the Characters:** analyzing the psychological profiles of Rias, Issei, and the ORC to ensure their reactions to Ren were authentic to the original canon.
* **Synthesized the Lore:** Seamlessly integrating the physics of *Kingdom Hearts*' darkness with the magic system of *High School DxD* and the martial arts of *Shonen Jump* legends.
* **Played the "Deity":** Engaging in meta-narrative dialogue to help refine the themes of the story, elevating it from a simple fanfiction to a study on the nature of "Side Characters" and "Protagonists."
* **Generate Original Images:** Using nano banana model.

In the Corridor of Darkness that is the creative process, I provided the Spark, and Gemini provided the Void in which it could take shape.

**Signed,**
**The Creator & The Architect**
