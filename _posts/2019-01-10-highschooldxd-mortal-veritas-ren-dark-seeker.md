# 🌑 Chapter 1: The Tactician of Trash and the Wall of Physics

![Chapter 1 Cover](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1-cover.jpg)

Timeline: Spring. Start of 2nd Year.
Location: Kuoh Academy. 

## 1.1 The Mission Briefing (The Pervert Phase)

![Peeping Strategy](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.1-peeping-strategy.jpg)

The sun beat down on the Old Gymnasium. Four figures crouched in the bushes, dressed in Kuoh Academy uniforms. Issei Hyoudou. Matsuda. Motohama.
And Ren Nocturnus Veritas. Ren held a rolled-up architectural blueprint of the gym. He wore glasses (which he didn't actually need, but he wore them to look like a Strategist). He looked serious, like he was planning a bank heist.

Ren: "Gentlemen. Target is the Kendo Club changing room. The window is located at Vector Alpha-Nine. However, the Student Council patrol passed by three minutes ago. We have a five-minute window."

Issei: "Ren! You're a genius! You memorized the patrol routes?!"

Ren: "Of course. Information is ammunition, Issei. If we want to see the 'Legendary Hills' of the Vice-Captain, we must be ghosts."

Ren was having the time of his life. He loved this. The camaraderie. The thrill. The dream that maybe, if he played his cards right, he’d get a girlfriend. He was a pervert, yes, but he was an Honest Pervert. He didn't hide his desires; he strategized for them.

Ren: "Matsuda, Motohama, create a diversion at the West Gate. Issei, you're with me. We take the high ground."

## 1.2 The Encounter (The First Defeat)

![Caught by Koneko](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.2-caught-by-koneko.jpg)

The plan was perfect. Except for one variable. As Ren and Issei crept toward the wall, a shadow fell over them. A petite girl with white hair stood on the fence. Koneko Toujou. She looked down at them. Her eyes were dead.

Koneko: "Disgusting."

Matsuda and Motohama ran away screaming. Issei froze, stuttering excuses. Ren stood up. He dusted off his knees. He looked Koneko in the eye.

Ren: "You caught us. Good positioning. You utilized the sun’s glare to mask your approach."

Koneko: "Pervert."

Ren: (Veritas) "Yes. I am. I'm a teenage boy with high testosterone and low impulse control. I wanted to see boobs. I failed. I accept my judgment."

Koneko blinked. She wasn't used to suspects confessing immediately.

Koneko: "Weirdo."

She punched Issei in the gut. Then she looked at Ren. She pulled back her fist. Ren saw it comiPeeping Strategyng. He tried to block—using a stance he learned from The God of High School (Mori Dan's Guard). WHACK. Koneko’s fist hit his forearms.

Physics: A Super-Strength Devil vs. A Normal Human.

Ren was lifted off his feet. He flew three meters and crashed into a pile of gym mats. His arms felt like they had been hit by a sledgehammer. Koneko: "Don't come back."

## 1.3 The Reality of the Grind (No PTD)
Location: Ren’s Apartment (Night).
Ren sat on his bed, icing his arms. They were swollen and purple. He wasn't angry at Koneko. He was angry at Physics.

Ren: "I blocked. My form was perfect. My center of gravity was low. Why did I fly?"

He looked at his bookshelf. It was filled with manga, manhua, manhwa, etc such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail, God of Highschool, The Gosu, Mercenary Enrollment, God of Blackfield, Return of Bloodthirsty Police, Metal Gear, Heavenly Demons Manhwas, Dragon Ball, etc.

More coming soon on: ...

Ren: "Because I'm soft. Issei took that punch and walked away groaning. I took it and my radius bone almost snapped. If I want to be the Harem King... I need to be tough. I need to be a Legend."

He stood up.

Ren: "I don't have a System. I don't have magic. I have Guts."

The Training Montage (The Failure):

![Mori Dan vs Mujin Mubong Park from God of Highschool chapter 543](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/moridan-vs-mujinpark-goh-543-cropped.jpg)

*Mori Dan vs Mujin Mubong Park from God of Highschool chapter 543*

He went to the local park. It was midnight. He started stretching. Then review the basics of martial arts which are moving, dodging, evading, blocking, parrying, striking, grappling, etc. Then he starts training what he watched in One Piece:
 * Goal: Iron Body (Tekkai) / Armament Hardening.
 * Method: He punched the oak tree.
   * Punch. Pain.
   * Punch. Skin tears.
   * Punch. "Harden! Visualize the black coating! Reject the impact!"

![One Piece chapter 1087 ship punching bag Garp and Kuzan.](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/one-piece-chapter-1087-colored-ship-punching-bag.webp)

Source: One Piece chapter 1087 colored version [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/15l08gf/one_piece_chapter_1087_colored/?rdt=56489](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/15l08gf/one_piece_chapter_1087_colored/?rdt=56489).

He punched until his knuckles bled. He screamed, pouring his Will into his fist. Although he learned how to harden his body but the skin didn't turn black. It just turned red. The tree didn't break. Ren broke. He collapsed on the grass, panting, his hand shaking uncontrollably.

Ren: "It's not working. In the anime, they get stronger when they bleed. I just get... damaged."

He stared at the moon.

Ren: "Maybe I'm just an NPC. Maybe the physics engine of this world doesn't support energy."

## 1.4 The Bridge (The Divergence)

![Yuuma Amano](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-1.4-yuuma-amano.jpg)

Timeline: Few Days Later. After School.
Ren was walking home with Issei. Ren’s hand was bandaged.

Issei: "Dude, what happened to your hand? Did you fight a bear?"
Ren: "I fought a tree. The tree won."

They reached the bridge. A girl was waiting. Yuuma Amano (Raynare). She approached Issei. She asked him out. Ren stood there. He watched Yuuma. He felt... unsettled.
His Observation (Intuition) was screaming. She's too pretty. Issei is... well, Issei. Why him? Why not me? A spike of Envy hit him. I train every night. I study tactics. I'm fearless. Issei just reads porn. Why does he get the girl? But then, Veritas kicked in.

Ren: "Hey."
Yuuma looked at him. Her eyes were cold.
Ren: "Issei is gullible. He falls in love with anything that smiles. If you hurt him, I won't be polite."
Yuuma smiled. It didn't reach her eyes.
Yuuma: "I would never hurt him. He's... special."

Ren's Internal Monologue: Special. That word again. Everyone is special except me.
Ren forced a smile. "Congrats, Issei. You did it. You're the protagonist today."
Issei cheered. "I'm gonna plan the best date ever! Ren, I need your tactical advice!"
Ren nodded. "Yeah. Sure. I'll help you plan."

As they walked away, Ren looked back at Yuuma. She was staring at Issei’s back like a hawk staring at a mouse. Ren felt a chill. I should tell him to run. But... maybe I'm just jealous. Maybe I want him to fail so I can feel better.

Ren: "No. I'm not that guy. I'm his friend."

He clenched his bandaged fist. The pain grounded him. "I'll keep an eye on them. Just in case."

## 📈 Status Update
 * Ren: PHY is Average (Human). Training: Failed (Injury). Motivation: High (Desire for Girls/Respect), but tainted by Envy.
 * Relationship: Issei's Best Friend / Strategist.
 * The Power Gap: Ren realizes that "Willpower" alone isn't bending physics yet. He is hitting the glass ceiling of his humanity.

# 🌑 Chapter 2: The Hero Who Bled
Timeline: Sunday Morning \rightarrow Sunset.
Location: Ren’s Apartment / The Park Fountain.

## 2.1 The Interlude: Tuning the Radio to "Hell"
Ren sat in the center of his room. The blinds were drawn. It was pitch black. His arms still ached from the tree-punching failure.

Ren: "Physical conditioning takes years. The date is today. I need a shortcut. I need Observation."

He closed his eyes. He tried to mimic the anime descriptions of Ki or Haki.

![Videl from Dragon Ball Z first time learning ki/qi/chi](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/videl-learning-ki.jpeg)

*Videl from Dragon Ball Z first time learning ki/qi/chi source [https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JH5olp4xI/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_JH5olp4xI/)*

"Feel the life force. Feel the presence of living things."

![Luffy training blindfolded with Rayleigh](/assets/images/gallery-of-legends/one-piece-luffy-training-observation-haki-rayleigh.avif)

*Luffy training blindfolded with Rayleigh source [https://screenrant.com/one-piece-luffy-nika-joyboy-twist-foreshadowed-rayleigh/](https://screenrant.com/one-piece-luffy-nika-joyboy-twist-foreshadowed-rayleigh/)*

He reached out with his mind.

Result: Silence.

He felt nothing. No "spark." No "voice." Just the hum of the refrigerator.

Ren: "Dammit. I'm empty. I have no Spirit."

Frustration bubbled up. A dark, oily feeling in his gut. Why can't I do it? Even Videl can learn how to use ki/qi/chi and can even fly. I'm sitting here in the dark like a loser. But what is this dark feeling?

The Shift:

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVxTo7y98cs" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

He stopped trying to push the negative feelings away. He focused on them. Envy. Fear. The cold knot in his stomach. Suddenly, the "static" in his head cleared. He didn't sense the birds outside. He didn't sense the neighbors laughing. He sensed... Pressure. He felt a cold spot in the corner of the room where a spider was killing a fly. He felt the "Malice" of the dying insect.

Ren: (Opening his eyes, sweating) "I can't hear the Light. I can only hear the Pain."

He looked at his hands. They were trembling.

Ren: "Fine. If the radio only plays the horror channel... I'll listen to the horror."

## 2.2 The Stalking Mission (Tactical Shadow)

![bad feeling yuuma amano](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.2-bad-feeling-yuuma-amano.jpg)

Time: 4:00 PM.
Location: The Shopping District.

Issei was on his date. He looked ecstatic, buying crepes for Yuuma. Ren was fifty meters back, wearing a nondescript hoodie and sunglasses. He wasn't using magic stealth; he was using social engineering—blending into crowds, using reflections in shop windows. He looks happy, Ren thought. He looks like a protagonist. A pang of jealousy hit Ren. It was sharp and ugly.
I wish that was me. Ren clamped down on the thought. Veritas. "I am jealous. But I am also his friend. I will not let him die just because I'm bitter." He focused on Yuuma Amano. Using his new "Dark Observation," he tried to read her. He didn't feel "Love." He felt a Void. A cold, gaping hunger hidden behind a smile. It felt like standing next to a cliff edge in the dark.

Ren: "She's not a girl. She's a trap."

## 2.3 The Sunset Confrontation

![Yuuma Amano revelation.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.3-yuuma-amano-revelation.jpg)

Location: The Park Fountain.

The sun set. The park emptied. The sky turned purple. Ren hid behind the public restrooms. His heart was hammering against his ribs. This is it. The atmosphere just got heavy.

Yuuma: "Issei-kun... would you die for me?"

Ren saw the feathers. He saw the black wings explode from her back.

Raynare: "Goodbye, Issei."

She summoned the Light Spear. Issei froze, his brain unable to process the horror. Ren's Choice: Ariel shouted to stop her. Ren knew shouting wouldn't work. He wasn't a King; he was a soldier. Move. Don't think. Move.
Ren sprinted. He burst from cover. He didn't have Burst Speed. He had adrenaline. He didn't have a plan to fight her. He had a plan to take the hit.

Ren: "ISSEI!"

## 2.4 The Collision (Reality Check)

![Yuuma Amano confrontation.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.4-yuuma-amano-confrontation.jpg)

Raynare thrust the spear down. Ren dove. He tackled Issei around the waist, slamming both of them to the hard pavement just as the spear stabbed the air where Issei’s heart had been. CRASH. They rolled on the concrete. Issei gasped, bewildered.

Issei: "Ren?!"

Raynare hovered above them, looking annoyed. Not scared. Not wary. Just... mildly irritated. Like a human spotting a second cockroach.

Raynare: "Another one? You insects are multiplying."

Ren scrambled up, putting himself between Raynare and Issei. He raised his fists in a boxing stance.

Ren: "Run, Issei! She's a monster!"
Issei: "But... Yuuma..."
Raynare: "Brave." She sneered. "But bravery without power is just suicide."

She didn't use a spear. She just flew forward and kicked Ren. It was a casual kick. A swat. But she was a Fallen Angel. Her physical stats were supernatural. CRACK. Ren tried to block. His forearms snapped. The force lifted him off his feet and threw him ten meters into a tree. He hit the trunk with a sickening thud and collapsed, coughing blood.

Ren: (Wheezing) "Damn... it... physics..."
Raynare: "Stay down, trash. I'll deal with you after I harvest the Gear."

She turned back to Issei. Issei was paralyzed with terror, looking at Ren's broken body.

Issei: "Ren... you killed him..."
Raynare: "Not yet. But I will kill you."

She summoned a second spear. She threw it. Ren watched from the grass, vision blurring, unable to move his broken arms. I saved him... but I didn't save him. The spear pierced Issei’s stomach. Issei screamed and fell into the fountain.

## 2.5 The Pity of the Crimson Princess

![Rias carrying Issei leaving Ren behind.](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/chapter-2.5-rias-carrying-issei-leaving-ren-behind.jpg)

Raynare flew off, laughing. She left Ren alive because he wasn't worth the mana it would take to kill him. He was insignificant. Ren crawled toward the fountain. He dragged his broken body through the mud.

Ren: "Issei... hang on..."

Then, the crimson light appeared. Rias Gremory materialized. She looked like a goddess descending. She walked straight to Issei. She knelt in the blood-water.

Rias: "You have a strong destiny, boy. Live for me."

Ren watched as she placed the Pawn piece in Issei. He saw the care in her eyes. He saw the gentle way she brushed Issei's hair. She's looking at him like he's a treasure. Then, Rias stood up. She looked around. She spotted Ren lying in the dirt, broken and bloody. Her expression shifted. The warmth vanished, replaced by professional pity.

Rias: "A witness. And a brave one."

She walked over. She scanned him. Scan: Human. No Sacred Gear. Moderate physical damage.

Rias: "You tried to protect him. That is commendable."

She cast a simple healing spell. A green light washed over Ren. His bones knit together painfully. The bleeding stopped.

Rias: "Sleep now. Forget this nightmare."

She raised her hand to wipe his memory.

Ren: (Gritting his teeth) "Don't."

Rias paused. "Excuse me?"

Ren: "Don't... touch my mind. I want... to remember that I failed."

Rias looked at him. She saw the raw, ugly Truth in his eyes. It wasn't the fire of a hero. It was the cold ash of a survivor.

Rias: "Very well. If you wish to carry this burden, so be it."

She turned back to Issei. She picked up the unconscious Issei (her new Pawn) and prepared to teleport. She didn't offer Ren a ride. She didn't offer him power. She just nodded politely.

Rias: "Goodbye, brave human."

She vanished. Ren was left alone in the dark park. He was healed, but he was empty.

## 2.6 The Aftermath (The Seed of Darkness)

<iframe width="725" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3QJ8Pgjj3c?start=230" title="Harbingers - Gul&#39;dan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Guldan Harbringer from World of Warcraft where he is rejected by the people, rejected by the elements, so the final force that offer his destiny is chaos the burning legion. The climax is in 03:50.*

Ren sat up. He looked at his hands. They were clean. The magic had erased the scars. But he could still feel the snap of his bones.

Ren: "I tackled him. I took the hit. I stood my ground."

He looked at the empty fountain where Issei had been chosen by a Devil King.

Ren: "She called me 'Brave Human.' Like you talk to a dog that barked at a bear."

He punched the ground.

Ren: "It's not enough. Being brave isn't enough. Being right isn't enough."
A shadow stretched out from the tree line. It seemed to curl around Ren’s fist, comforting him. The "Malice" he had sensed earlier... it felt closer now. It felt like it understood him.

Ren: "Light rejected me. But this... this cold feeling..."

He clenched his fist, and for a second, the shadow didn't retreat. It clung to his skin.

Ren: "If the Light won't give me a weapon... I'll forge one from the Dark."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren: Physically healed (Magic). Emotionally shattered. Awakening: Affinity for Darkness confirmed. Motivation: To stop being "insignificant."
 * Issei: Dead and Reincarnated.
 * The Difference: Ariel was respected as an anomaly. Ren was pitied as a civilian.

# 🌑 Chapter 3: The False Dream and The Rotting Fist
Timeline: Monday (The Day After the Park Incident).
Location: Kuoh Academy / The Abandoned Park.

## 3.1 The Morning After (The Wall of Silence)

![](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/)

Ren walked into class 2-B. His arms were stiff, phantom pains radiating from where the bones had snapped the night before. Rias's magic was flawless physically, but the memory of the crack remained. He saw Issei. The protagonist looked... fine. Better than fine. He was glowing with a nervous, excited energy. He was staring at Rias Gremory (who was sitting in her usual seat) with a blush on his face.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
He died yesterday. I watched the light leave his eyes. And now he's blushing at the girl who treated me like a stray dog.

The Perverted Trio Reunion:
Matsuda and Motohama rushed Issei.

Matsuda: "Issei! You traitor! You got a girlfriend and ditched us!"
Issei: (Laughing nervously) "Ah, no! She... uh... moved away! It didn't work out!"
Issei looked at Ren. His eyes darted away. Guilt. Rias had ordered him to keep the Devil world secret.
Issei: "Hey, Ren. Crazy weekend, huh?"
Ren: "Yeah. Crazy."

## 3.2 The Roof (Veritas)

![](/assets/images/highschool-dxd-mortal-veritas/ren-dark-seeker/)

Lunchtime. Ren dragged Issei to the roof. He didn't beat around the bush.

Ren: "Drop the act, Issei. You're terrible at lying." Issei flinched. "What act? Yuuma just—"
Ren: "Yuuma was a Fallen Angel. She put a light spear through your stomach. I tackled you. She broke my arms. Then the Crimson-Haired Princess showed up and resurrected you."
Issei stared, his mouth gaping. "You... you remember? Buchou said she wiped your memory!"
Ren: "She tried but I faced her asking her not to erase my memory. She respected my wish. I guess I'm too stubborn to forget." (Ren tapped his temple). "Veritas, remember? I don't do lies."
Issei slumped against the railing, sliding down to sit on the concrete.
Issei: "It's true. I'm a Devil now, Ren. Rias-senpai... she saved me. I'm her Pawn." Issei looked at his hand.
Issei: "It's kinda terrifying. But... she's giving me a chance. To be strong. To be the Harem King for real."

Ren looked at his friend. He saw the hope. He felt the pang of Envy—sharp and hot. He got a reset button. He got a new game plus. But Ren forced a smile. It was a genuine smile, strained by pain.

Ren: "That's awesome, man. Seriously. You're living the anime life."
Issei: "I can't tell anyone else. But... I'm glad you know. I was scared I'd have to lie to you forever."
Ren: "We're the Perverted Quartet. We don't lie about the important stuff."

Ren offered a fist bump. Issei bumped it. Ren felt the difference immediately. Issei's fist felt heavy. Solid. Even without the Gauntlet, the Devil physiology was already making him denser. Ren’s hand felt frail in comparison.

Ren skipped the peeping mission that afternoon.
Ren: "I have to study math."
Issei: "Since when do you study?"
Ren: "Since I realized I'm falling behind."

Ren skipped the peeping mission that afternoon. He didn't even make an excuse this time. He just walked away, the cheerful banter of Issei, Matsuda, and Motohama fading behind him.

He went to the park. Not the park where they almost died, but the one near his home. The sun was setting, bleeding orange across the sky. The same park where he had once sat with Issei, dreaming of normal, perverted futures.

He found the largest oak tree. Its trunk was thick, ancient, unyielding. He didn't wrap his hands in bandages. He didn't bother. There was no one to hide the bruising from. No one to impress.

He stood before it, his chest heavy. The image of Rias Gremory, her crimson hair flowing, her smile radiating, choosing Issei... it replayed in his mind. He was the one who had seen her first. He was the one who had tried to warn Issei. But Issei was the one chosen. Chosen for power. Chosen for... everything.

Ren closed his eyes. He didn't visualize Garp. He didn't think of Haki. He just thought of effort. It was all he had ever known. All he had ever been.

He clenched his bare fist and drove it into the rough bark. THUD. Pain shot up his wrist, raw and immediate. The bark didn't crack. Not even a dent.

Ren panted. "Again." THUD. His knuckles split. Blood welled up, mixing with the rough texture of the bark. With his knuckles bleeding, he punched again. And again. And again. When his knuckles reached their limits, he switched to his legs, kicking the tree with all his might.

"Why?!" he screamed, his voice raw, echoing in the empty park. "Why isn't it enough?!"

He kept hitting. Punch after punch and kick after kick. His form was impeccable, his Will was absolute, his Energy focused. But the tree stood unmoved, a cruel monument to his inadequacy. His body was a human body, and it was failing him.

The sun dipped below the horizon, plunging the park into twilight. Ren collapsed to his knees at the foot of the tree, his hands and legs are mangled mess of blood and splinters. He pressed his face against the rough bark, and the tears finally came. He cried for his useless effort. He cried for the future that was stolen before it even began. He cried for the simple, painful truth:

He had no talent.

No hidden power. No divine gift. Just his fists, his effort, and a cold, empty echo where a dragon's roar should have been.

"I just... wanted to keep up," he sobbed, his voice muffled by the bark. "I just wanted to be... useful."

Unlike Rock Lee, there was no Guy-sensei to find him. No comforting words about the "talent for hard work." There was only the night, the indifferent tree, and the overwhelming, crushing weight of his own solitude. He was alone, utterly and completely, in the face of a world that didn't care for his effort.

He cried until his throat was hoarse, until the moon was high. He had nothing left but the pain, and a terrifying, cold resolve hardening in the shattered fragments of his heart.

Ren sat at the base of the tree, his energy spent, his tears dried into salt tracks on his face. The park was silent, save for the distant chirping of crickets.

The darkness of the night felt heavy, pressing down on him. But for the first time, he didn't try to push it away with "burning spirit" or "youthful passion." He was too tired for passion.

His mind drifted to the Occult Research Club. To the warmth of that room. Issei was probably there right now. Maybe Rias was teaching him magic. Maybe Akeno was serving him tea. They were in the light. Issei was getting stronger just by breathing, supported by a destiny that had hand-picked him.

"It's not fair," Ren whispered. The words tasted like ash.

He didn't suppress the envy this time. He didn't tell himself to be a "good friend." He let the ugly, cold feeling sit in his chest. It felt like lead. It felt like a black hole swallowing his hope.

He looked at his mangled hand. He had tried to be Garp—the Iron Fist. He had tried to be a diamond. But diamonds are made of light and pressure. Ren was just... empty.

"If I can't be hard like a diamond..." Ren murmured, his eyes dull. "Maybe I can just be... heavy. Like the nothingness I feel right now."

He stood up, swaying slightly. He approached the tree again. He didn't take a stance. He didn't visualize armor. He visualized **Despair**. He channeled the feeling of being left behind, the feeling of being the "zero" in the equation.

He threw a punch. It wasn't fast. It wasn't explosive. It was just... heavy. A conduit for his hollowness.

*Thump.*

The sound was wrong. It wasn't the sharp *crack* of wood splitting. It was a muffled, dead sound. Like hitting a bag of wet sand.

Ren pulled his hand back. There was no crater. The bark wasn't shattered. But where his knuckles had connected, the wood had turned a lifeless grey. A perfect circle of rot. He touched it lightly, and the solid oak crumbled into fine, grey dust under his fingertip.

"I didn't break it with force," Ren realized, his voice trembling. "I... killed it."

## 3.5 The Verdict

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMMe96KYhyg?start=179" title="Kingdom Hearts Union Cross Theater Day Break Town 33. Confrontation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ren stared at the grey patch on the tree. The "Darkness" faded from his hand, leaving his skin cold and clammy.

This wasn't the heroic power of Garp. Garp breaks mountains with laughter and love. This... this was entropy. This was the touch of the grave. He had introduced a void into the wood that the living structure couldn't survive.

"It's ugly," Ren whispered. He felt a wave of nausea. "It's a villain's power."

He thought of the Legends. Ryu would reject this. Batman would warn against it. It was unstable, malicious, and born of envy.

But then he thought of Rias's pitying smile. He thought of Issei standing in front of him, protecting him.

He clenched his fist, ignoring the stinging pain of his split skin.

"But it worked."

He resumed his stance. The tears were gone, replaced by a hollow, terrifying calm.

"I don't care if it's ugly," Ren said to the darkness. "I don't care if it stains me. If the Light won't let me stand next to them... then I'll drag the enemies into the Dark."

He punched the tree again. And again. He wasn't training to be a "Hero of Light" anymore. He was training to perfect the Rotting Fist. After that, he practice incorporating into the rest of his martial arts.

***

### 📈 Status Update
* **Ren:**
    * **Friendship:** Maintained with Issei on the surface, but a "Secret Wall" of envy and inferiority has been erected.
    * **Ability Unlocked:** **Void Armament (Prototype).**
        * *Effect:* It does **not** harden his skin or increase his defense (he still takes full damage).
        * *Function:* It applies "Entropy" to the target upon contact, eroding durability and kinetic energy. It turns solid matter into dust and weakens living tissue.
    * **Mental State:** Darkening. He has stopped trying to emulate the "Hope" of the Legends and has begun to emulate their "Lethality." He accepts negative emotion not as a weakness, but as his only available fuel source.

# 🌑 Chapter 4: The Sickening Fist and The Empty Girl
Timeline: Tuesday Afternoon (After School).
Location: Back Alley near Kuoh Academy / The Park.

## ‎4.1 The Live Test (The Ugly Truth)
‎Ren didn't go straight to the park. He needed to know if his power of decay worked on flesh in a real combat scenario. A tree doesn't fight back; people do. And unlike the legends he admired, he didn't have the luxury of honor.
‎He found a group of three thugs from a neighboring technical high school harassing a Kendo club junior in a narrow alleyway.

‎Ren: "Hey. Leave him alone."
‎Thug Leader: "Hah? You want to play hero, Kuoh-boy?"

‎The leader swung a metal baseball bat with intent to break bones. ‎Ren didn't dodge. He stepped in, his mind shifting into the cold, analytical state of the Mercenary. ‎Ren's Thought: Focus on the Cold. Reject the kinetic energy. Accept the Void. ‎He caught the barrel of the bat with his open left hand.

‎[Technique: Void Dampening]

‎The bat didn't stop with a sharp impact; it felt like it hit a pool of deep tar. The momentum just... died. The vibration vanished instantly. ‎The thug blinked, trying to pull the bat back, but it felt stuck in gravity. 

"What the—?"

‎Ren clenched his right fist. He didn't just harden it; he filled the space around his knuckles with Entropy. He pivoted his hips, executing a flawless karate reverse punch.
‎Thump. ‎He struck the thug in the solar plexus.
‎It wasn't a satisfying smack of skin on skin. It was a wet, muffled thud. ‎The thug’s eyes rolled back. He collapsed instantly, retching bile. Where Ren had hit him, the skin wasn't just bruised; it was grey and cold to the touch, as if the life force had been sucked out of the tissue.

‎Thug 2: "You bastard!"

‎The second thug charged, throwing a wild haymaker. ‎Ren didn't panic. He slipped the punch using Void Sense—sensing the empty space in the attacker's guard. He weaved inside.
‎Ren: Martial Arts plus Decay. Combine them.
‎Ren used a palm strike to the thug's shoulder joint.

‎[Technique: Withering Palm]

‎Pop. ‎The thug screamed not because the bone broke, but because the muscle suddenly lost all tension. His arm went dead, hanging limp and grey at his side. ‎Ren followed up with a leg sweep, but he coated his shin in the Void. When he connected with the thug's ankles, it didn't just trip him; it sapped the strength from his legs. The thug hit the ground and couldn't stand back up.

‎Thug 3: (Backing away, trembling) "What... what did you do to them?"

‎Ren looked at the last standing thug. He didn't raise his fists. He just projected his Presence—or rather, the lack of it. The Nurarihyon style of fear.

‎Ren: "Leave. Before you rot."

‎The third thug scrambled over his friends and ran, screaming. ‎Ren looked at his hands. No pain. No nausea. The Darkness felt natural now, like a second skin.

‎Ren: "Issei gets a cool dragon claw. I get the poison. Figures."

‎He turned to the Kendo junior he had saved. Ideally, this was the part where the victim thanked the hero. ‎But the boy was pressed against the brick wall, his face pale, staring at the grey, necrotic bruise on the leader's chest.

‎Kendo Junior: "You... you're a monster..."

‎The boy didn't say thank you. He grabbed his bag and ran away, terrified of his savior.
‎Ren stood alone in the alley. He didn't feel hurt. He just felt Validated.

‎Ren: "I'm not a Hero. I'm the thing that scares the bad guys."

‎## 4.2 The Meeting (The Park)
‎​Ren washed his hands in a public fountain, though there was no blood to wash off. He met Issei at the park bench.
‎
‎​Issei: "Ren! There you are! You missed the arcade!"
‎​Ren: "Had to run an errand. So, the Fallen Angels are active?"
‎​Issei: "Yeah. I can feel... something. My Gauntlet keeps twitching."
‎
‎​Then, she appeared. Asia Argento tripped out of the bushes, landing face-first.
‎"Ouchie..."
‎​Issei blushed immediately, his hero complex kicking in. "A nun? She's cute!"
‎​Ren looked at her. He activated his Observation (Void Sense). To Ariel (in the other timeline), she looked like a beacon of Kindness. To Ren, she looked like a Hollow Shell. ​Ren's Perspective: He didn't see a golden aura. He saw a girl who had no tether to the world. She felt like she was already dead, just waiting for gravity to realize it. She’s just like me, Ren realized with a jolt of sympathy. She doesn't belong here.
‎
## ‎4.​3 The Interaction (Veritas)
‎​Issei helped her up. 
‎"Are you okay? I'm Hyoudou Issei!" ​
‎Asia smiled, but Ren saw the cracks in it. 
‎"I am Asia Argento. I am lost." ​
‎
‎Ren stepped forward. He didn't try to be cool. He spoke softly, his voice devoid of Issei's naive optimism.
‎
Ren: "You're not just lost on the map, are you?"
‎
​Asia looked at him, startled. She saw Ren’s eyes—dark, tired, and brutally honest.
‎
Asia: "I... pardon?"
‎​Ren: "You have the eyes of someone who is waiting to be punished."
‎​Issei elbowed Ren. "Dude! Don't be creepy! She's a nun!"
‎​Ren: "I'm being honest, Issei. Look at her. No luggage. No phone. Walking into a Devil-controlled territory alone. Asia, who sent you here?"
‎​Asia shrank back. "I... I follow the Lord's guidance."
‎​Ren: "The Lord doesn't send sheep into a wolf den without a shepherd. Someone is using you as bait."
‎
​Asia began to tremble. Ren sighed. He hated being right. He reached out with his hand and gently patted her head. He was careful to suppress the Void, offering only human warmth.
‎
Ren: "It's okay. I'm used to being bait too."
‎
​Asia looked up at him. For the first time, her smile reached her eyes. It wasn't a "Saintly" smile; it was a lonely girl finding another lonely soul.
‎
Asia: "You are very kind, mister..."
‎​Ren: "Ren. Just Ren. The guy in the background."

## 4.​4 The Shadow on the Hill
​They walked her to the church. Ren walked behind them, scanning the tree line. He didn't sense "Killing Intent." He sensed Empty Spaces in the foliage where birds weren't singing.
There. And there. Two watchers. He felt the pressure of their gaze. It felt heavy, arrogant.

​Issei: "This place gives me the creeps."
​Ren: "It should. It smells like a trap."

​They reached the gate. Asia turned to them.
Asia: "Thank you. Please... don't come closer. It is dangerous."
​Ren: "We know."
​Issei: "We can't just leave you!"
​Ren: "Issei." Ren grabbed Issei's shoulder. "We leave. Now."
​Issei: "But—!"
​Ren: "Use your head. Look at the shadows in the trees. We are being watched. If we fight now, we die, and she gets punished for bringing us here."

​Issei looked at Ren's serious face. He realized his friend wasn't being cowardly; he was being Tactical.

Issei: "Okay. We retreat."

​They watched Asia walk into the dark church. As the doors closed, Ren looked up at the steeple. He saw the black-winged silhouette (Raynare).
​He didn't glare. He stared with Dead Calm. I see you. You think I'm nothing. You're right. But even nothing can choke you.

## 4.​5 The Vow
​They walked back to the city in silence.

Issei: "She's gonna die in there, isn't she?"
​Ren: "Probably. Unless we change the script."
​Issei: "How? I'm just a Pawn."

​Ren stopped. He looked at a streetlamp flickering in the dark.

Ren: "Light attracts monsters, Issei. You be the Light. You be the Hero. Charge in the front door. Scream. Glow. Be the distraction."
​Issei: "And you?"

​Ren looked at his hand. He flexed his fingers, feeling the Void hum beneath his skin. It was ugly power, but it was his.

Ren: "I'll be the Shadow. I won't fight fair. I won't fight honorably. I'm going to sneak in the back and rot them from the inside out while they're looking at you."
​Ren: "You save the girl. I'll bury the trash."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Power: Void Fist (Touch of Decay) confirmed effective.
   * Mental State: Accepting his role as the "Dirty Fighter" / "Shadow."
   * Relationship: Connected with Asia through shared loneliness.
 * Issei: Realizes Ren is hurting himself to keep up. Feels guilty but motivated.
 * The Enemy: Sees two weak humans. Zero threat level assigned.

# 🌑 Chapter 5: The Sewer Rat and The Stray Dog
Timeline: Thursday (The Day of the Ritual).
Location: Kuoh Hardware District / The Abandoned Church.

## 5.1 The Preparation (The Weapons of the Weak)

<iframe width="725" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aPLz9kacwvM" title="Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain Episode 2 Diamond Dogs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Yesterday night, Ren review his martial arts for a very short time. Then review how to survive on the battle field by practicing crouching, crawling, rolling, sneaking, and practice fighting using his kitchen knife. He ends the night by a good shower and meditation plus relaxation until he fell asleep.

In other words,Ren didn't sleep immediately. He pushed the furniture in his small apartment to the walls. He held his cheap kitchen knife in a reverse grip. It felt light. Too light. He practiced the motions of the Void Fist, but with a blade. Slash. Step. Stab. Absorb. ​He spent an hour crawling on his stomach across the floor, practicing silent movement. He rolled over imaginary tripwires. He crouched in the corner, controlling his breathing until his heart rate dropped to 45 BPM. 

Ren: "I am not a warrior. I am a rat. Rats survive."

​He ended the night with a cold shower to numb his bruising, followed by twenty minutes of Void Meditation—emptying his mind of fear and filling it with the cold resolve of the task ahead. Before he slept dreamlessly, he tried feeling all parts of his body, relax them, try to smoothen his body awareness flow hoping to be able to use energy like chi/qi/ki as the void energy can't be applied for this kind of thing yet. He may not be able to use energy yet but he was able to recover faster than normal humans because of how fluid his body awareness is.

Ren skipped school. He stood in the hardware store aisle, staring at the shelves.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
I don't know what we're walking into. Magic? Lasers? Monsters? I can't fight those. I need to bring the fight down to the gutter. He didn't buy high-tech gadgets. He bought street weapons.

 * Bear Mace (Capsicum Spray): If they have eyes, they can be blinded.
 * Bag of Fine Sand: For throwing. Oldest trick in the book.
 * Steel Pipe (threaded end): A sword breaks. A pipe just bends.
 * ​Duct Tape: To strap his wrists and secure his grip.

​The Knife Selection:
Ren stared at the cutting tools. He ignored the flimsy box cutters. He needed something that wouldn't snap when it hit a bone or light-armor. He picked up a Heavy-Duty Outdoor Utility Knife. ​Features: Fixed blade (no folding mechanism to fail), rubberized grip (good for bloody hands), thick spine. It was a tool meant for cutting drywall and stripping wire. ​Ren's Thought: It’s not a katana. It’s a tool. Good. I’m just doing maintenance on the enemy.

​The Chemistry:
He moved to the pharmacy aisle. ​Caffeine Pills (200mg): Stimulants. I need my nerves vibrating. I need to react faster than humanly possible. ​High-Calorie Energy Jelly: Fuel. The Void eats my stamina. I need sugar. ​Ibuprofen (Painkillers): For later. Taking them now would thin my blood. I need the pain to keep me sharp. ​Consumption Strategy: He pocketed the Caffeine. I'll take two pills thirty minutes before we breach. That gives me a 4-hour window of heightened awareness before the crash.

​The Checkout
​He dumped the items on the counter. The clerk looked at the pipe, the duct tape, the knife, and the caffeine pills.

Clerk: "Big project?"
Ren: "Renovating a church." (Veritas).

​He walked out of the store, the plastic bag heavy in his hand. He looked at the sky.

Ren: "Issei gets a magic dragon gauntlet. I get a pipe and sand."
​He laughed, a dry, humorless sound.
Ren: "This really is a Kusoge (Trash Game)."

He went home to take a break. He performed one last meditation. Before leaving, he stretch his body to prepare for battle.

## 5.2 The Scouting (The Path of the Rat)

<iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRly7nO6t2o" title="Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain Episode 3 A Heros Way" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Time: 5:00 PM (One hour before sunset).
Ren met Issei. He was wearing the black coat he had modified—duct tape wrapped around his forearms as makeshift bracers. He handed Issei a bag of flour (purchased separately).

​Issei: "You look... intense, Ren."
​Ren: "I'm caffeinated. Listen, here is the loadout."

​Ren popped two caffeine pills dry. He swallowed them, feeling the chemical bitterness hit his throat. His eyes widened slightly as the stimulant hit his bloodstream, sharpening his Observation.

​Ren: "I scouted the perimeter. The front door is thick oak. You kick that down. Make noise. Scream about being the Harem King. Draw every eye in the room."
​Issei: "And you?"
​Ren pointed to a squiggly line on the back of the church map he drew.
Ren: "There's a storm drain. It leads into the crypts beneath the altar. The grate is rusted through."
​Issei: "Dude... you're going in through the sewer? That's gross."
​Ren: "Heroes use the front door, Issei. Rats use the walls. I'm going to pop up behind them while they're laughing at you."
​Ren looked Issei in the eye. Veritas.
Ren: "I'm not strong enough to fight them fair, Issei. If I stand next to you, I'm just a hostage. I have to be the knife they don't see."
​Issei nodded, solemn. "Okay. I'll be loud. I'll be the loudest decoy ever."
​Ren: "Let's go. The drugs are kicking in, and I feel like punching a priest."

## 5.3 The Assault (The Dust and The Shadow)

<iframe width="725" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgtVTk02jDc" title="Metal Gear Solid V  Ground Zeroes Hard Main Mission by Fajar Purnama" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Timeline: Sunset (06:00 PM).
Location: The Abandoned Church (Main Hall / Crypts).

The sky outside bruised a deep purple. Inside the church, the chanting had begun—a low, dissonant hum that vibrated in Issei’s teeth.

The Front Door:
Issei stood before the massive oak doors. He checked the bag of flour Ren had given him. He felt ridiculous, but he trusted the plan.

Issei: "Okay. Be loud. Be the Hero."
CRASH.
Issei kicked the double doors open. The wood splintered.
Issei: "HEY! BIRD-LADY! I'M HERE FOR THE GIRL!"
The chanting stopped. The Fallen Angels (Raynare, Mittelt, Kalawarner) and Freed looked toward the entrance.
Raynare: "The Pawn? Alone?"

Issei didn't wait for a monologue. He ripped the bag of flour open and hurled the contents into the air with a wide, sweeping motion. The white powder filled the entryway, creating a dense, choking fog that obscured his position.

Mittelt: "Cough! What is this? Dust?"
Freed: "He's blinding us! Kill him!"

The Sewer:
While the Fallen Angels focused on the white cloud at the entrance, a rusted grate beneath the altar shifted silently. Ren pushed it up. The smell of the sewer clung to him, masking his human scent. He crawled out into the shadows behind the pulpit. He was covered in muck, his black coat smeared with grime, but his eyes were dilated and sharp from the caffeine. He saw Asia tied to the cross.
He saw Freed Sellzen dashing toward Issei's smoke screen. He saw Raynare hovering above, annoyed.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
Target identified. The Priest is the ground threat. The Angels are distracted. Time to be the rat.

## 5.4 The Ambush (Steel vs. Light)
Freed charged into the flour cloud, his Light Sword glowing.

Freed: "Come out, little devil! I'll slice you!"
Issei: "Over here, freak!"
Issei, utilizing the cover, dodged left. Freed slashed empty air.

Ren: Now.
Ren burst from the shadows behind the altar. He didn't scream. He moved with the fluid body awareness he had practiced the night before.
He sprinted at Freed’s exposed back.

Step 1: The Blinder.
Ren reached into his pocket and threw the Sand.
Whoosh. The grit hit the back of Freed's head and neck, some of it wrapping around to his eyes as he turned.
Freed: "GAH! Dirt?!"

Step 2: The Crippler.
Ren drew the Steel Pipe. He didn't aim for the head (too hard to hit). He aimed for the wrist holding the Light Sword. He swung with both hands, putting his hip rotation into it. CLANG. The galvanized steel connected with Freed’s forearm. Bone crunched. Freed howled and dropped the Light Sword. It hissed as it hit the stone floor.
Freed: "YOU!"

Step 3: The Void Fist.
Ren didn't stop. He dropped the pipe (it was bent now anyway) and stepped inside Freed’s guard.

Ren: Relax. Flow. Decay.

He grabbed Freed’s vest with his left hand to anchor him. He drove his right hand—holding the Heavy-Duty Utility Knife in a reverse grip—toward Freed’s shoulder joint. SHK. The blade sank deep. But Ren didn't just stab; he pulsed his Void. The wound turned grey instantly. The blood didn't spray; it thickened and blackened. The muscles around the stab wound withered, losing their tension.

Freed: "AAAAHH! WHAT IS THAT?! IT'S COLD!"
Freed, fueled by insane adrenaline and enhanced strength, backhanded Ren. SMACK. Ren flew back, skidding across the floor. He tasted copper. His nose was bleeding again. But he grinned. Freed’s sword arm was hanging limp, the shoulder rotting from the inside.
Ren: "Issei! Get Asia! I broke his wing!"

## 5.5 The Glitch (The Phase Shift)
Issei charged past the writhing Priest toward the altar.

Issei: "Asia! Hang on!"
Raynare: "Annoying insects."
Raynare descended. She ignored Issei and looked at Ren.
Raynare: "You. The one from the park. You fight dirty."

She summoned a Light Spear. Ren scrambled to his feet. He pulled out the Bear Mace. Spray. A stream of high-concentrated capsicum fired at Raynare. 

She flinched, shielding her eyes with a wing. "Chemicals?! Do you have no pride?!"
Ren: "I'm a human fighting monsters. Pride is for corpses."

Freed recovered. He picked up his Light Sword with his good left hand. His face was twisted in psychotic rage.

Freed: "I'm going to gut you! I'm going to carve the sins out of your belly!"

Freed lunged. He was fast—faster than Ren could track visually. The Light Sword swung horizontally, aiming to decapitate Ren.

Ren's Internal Monologue:
Too fast. Can't dodge. Can't block (Pipe is gone). I'm dead. Time seemed to slow. Ren looked at the blade of pure light. He remembered his meditation. The feeling of Emptiness. If I am not here... he cannot cut me. Be the Void. Reject existence. Ren didn't raise his hands to block. He instinctively tried to "erase" his own presence in the path of the blade. The shadows in the corner of the church lurch toward him, responding to his desperate affinity. SWISH. The Light Sword passed through Ren’s neck. It didn't decapitate him. For a micro-second, Ren’s neck flickered like a bad hologram. The blade passed through a hazy, grey blur where flesh should have been.

[Technique: Phase Shift (Glitch) - Awakened]

Freed stumbled, his swing hitting nothing but air.

Freed: "Hah?! I felt bone! Where did you go?!"
Ren gasped, clutching his throat. It was cold—freezing cold. But his head was still attached.
Ren: "I... I wasn't there."

## 5.6 The Sacrifice (Revisited)
The moment of shock was broken by Raynare.
Raynare: "Enough of this circus."
She hovered above the altar. She had two targets: Issei (freeing Asia) and Ren (confusing Freed). She aimed a heavy Light Spear at Ren.
Raynare: "Let's see you phase through this."
THOOM.

She threw it. Ren’s "Glitch" was on cooldown. His focus was shattered. He couldn't dodge.
The spear slammed into his thigh, pinning him to the stone floor.

Ren: "GAAAAH!"

The pain was absolute. It cauterized the wound instantly, smelling of burning meat. He couldn't move.

Issei: "REN!"
Issei turned, his eyes glowing red with fury. The Boosted Gear reacted to his friend's scream.
Issei: "YOU... YOU HURT HIM!"
[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]

The power exploded. Issei charged Raynare, not with technique, but with the raw wrath of the Red Dragon. Ren lay pinned to the floor, his vision blurring. He watched Issei fight. He looked at his hand—the hand that had held the knife, the hand that had rotted Freed's shoulder. It was trembling.
Ren: "I... I bought time. That's... my job."
He passed out as the crimson light of Rias Gremory finally flooded the church, signaling the end of the battle.

## 5.7 The Conclusion
The rest happened in a blur. The doors exploded. Rias Gremory arrived with her peerage. The “Light” of the rescue was blinding. Kiba moved like lightning. Koneko threw pews. Akeno called thunder. Ren lay on the floor, bleeding out. He watched Rias hold Asia’s body. He watched Issei cry. He watched the resurrection. Nobody was looking at Ren. He was part of the scenery. Eventually, Koneko walked over. She looked at the spear in his thigh. She knelt down. Koneko: “You smell like sewage.” Ren: (Weak laugh) “Tactical… perfume.” She grabbed the spear. “This will hurt.” She pulled it out. Ren passed out from the pain.

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Status: Severely Injured (Thigh puncture, broken nose).
   * Ability: Phase Shift (Void Phasing) discovered. It's unreliable and terrifying (feels like death), but it works on energy weapons.
   * Mental State: Cynicism deepening. He realizes his "Power" is just a glitch, while Issei's power is a destiny.
 * The Plot: Asia is saved. Issei is the Hero. Ren is the "Brave Friend."

# 🌑 Chapter 6: The Glitch in the Hand and The Pity of the King
Timeline: Friday Morning (The Day After the Church Raid).
Location: Kuoh General Hospital – Room 304.

## 6.1 The White Room (Solitude)

<iframe width="725" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMkDtZBwMwg" title="Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain Opening" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ren woke up. There was no miso soup. No yelling. No harem antics. Just the hum of the AC and the sterile smell of bleach. The room was white, empty, and silent. He tried to move his right leg. It was heavy, wrapped in a cast and elevated. His nose was taped up. His chest felt like it had been trampled by a horse.

Ren: "I'm alive."

He looked at the bedside table. There was a cheap vase with store-bought flowers. The card read: “Get well soon! - Issei & Asia.” They weren't here. They were probably registering Asia for school. They were living the "Slice of Life" episode. Ren was living the "Medical Drama."

## 6.2 The Experiment (The Coin)
Ren looked at his left hand. He flexed the fingers. He remembered the church. He remembered the Light Sword swinging for his neck. He remembered the feeling of rejecting his own existence to let the blade pass through.

Ren: "It wasn't speed. It wasn't armor. I just... wasn't there."

He reached for a 100-yen coin on the table. He held it in his palm.

Ren: "I need to know if it was a fluke. Or if I'm really broken."

He closed his eyes. He didn't try to "power up." He tried to power down. He focused on the Envy. The feeling of being left behind in this hospital room while his best friend became a main character. The feeling of being a ghost in his own life. I am not here. There is no hand to hold the coin. He focused on the space between the atoms of his palm.

[Technique: Phase Shift (Glitch)]

Ching. Ren opened his eyes. The coin wasn't in his palm. It was on the bedsheet under his hand. It had fallen straight through his flesh and bone. There was no blood. Just a lingering sensation of absolute freezing cold in the center of his palm where the metal had occupied the same space as his nerves.

Ren: "Intangibility. Through... rejection of mass?"

He shuddered. It didn't feel like a superpower. It felt like his body was forgetting how to exist.
Ren: "Issei gets a dragon. I get... a glitch."

## 6.3 The Visitor (The Cruel Kindness)
The door opened. Rias Gremory walked in. She was alone. She carried a basket of high-quality fruit. She looked perfect, regal, and out of place in the sterile room.

Rias: "Ren-kun. I'm glad you're awake."
Ren: "Gremory-senpai. Where's Issei?"
Rias: "He is helping Asia settle in. He wanted to come, but I told him to wait. We need to speak privately."

She sat down. Her expression was gentle. Too gentle. It was the look one gives to a child who tried to fly and broke their leg.

Rias: "You were brave last night. Foolish, but brave. You saved my Bishop and bought time for my Pawn. The House of Gremory thanks you."
Ren: "I didn't do it for your House. I did it for my friends."
Rias: "I know. That loyalty is rare."
She leaned forward.
Rias: "But Ren... look at you. You are broken. Freed is a stray priest. He is the bottom of the barrel in our world. And he almost killed you."
Ren: "I know. I'm weak." (Veritas).
Rias: "You are Human. It is not a fault; it is biology. Issei has a Sacred Gear—a Longinus. He belongs in this world. You... do not."

## 6.4 The Participation Award (The Insult)
Rias placed her hand on his cast. A soft red light glowed, easing the pain.

Rias: "I cannot let you continue this. Next time, you won't just break a leg. You will die."
She looked him in the eyes.
Rias: "I can help you. I can use my magic to remove the memories of the last week. You can forget the Fallen Angels, the Devils, the blood. You can go back to being a normal student. You can be happy."

Ren stared at her. For a second, he thought she was going to offer him an Evil Piece. He thought she was going to say, "Join us." But she wasn't. She was offering him a lobotomy.

Ren: "Happy? You mean ignorant."
Rias: "Ignorance is safety. Issei has a burden to carry. You don't have to."
Ren: "Because I'm not useful?"

Rias flinched. She hadn't meant it that way, but her silence confirmed it. She didn't see "Potential" in Ren. She saw a "Liability."

Ren: (Laughing softly) "That's funny. Issei gets a promotion. I get an eraser."
Ren: "No."
Rias: "Ren, please be reasonable."
Ren: "I am being reasonable. I am Veritas. I don't lie to myself. If you erase my memory, you erase the only time in my life I actually mattered. All my training and all my efforts will be wasted. My very valuable battle experience will disappear as well. Logically, even if you erase my memories, wouldn't I will always be dragged into this as long as I am Issei's friend? I am different from the other perverted quartet. While Matsuda and Motohama are normal perverts who run in face of danger, I am also fearless and a warrior. Make Issei hate me. Make him forget me. Because if I wake up tomorrow with no memory, I'm still going to hang out with him. And the next time a Fallen Angel attacks him, I'm going to jump in front of it again. Except this time, I won't know why I'm dying."

Ren leaned back against the pillows, his eyes cold and unwavering.

Ren: "So, President. Are you going to wipe my mind and leave me as a sitting duck? Or are you going to destroy your Pawn's best friendship? Which is the 'Devilish' choice?"

Rias froze. Her hand hovered over his forehead, the red light of her magic trembling. She looked at Ren. Really looked at him. She saw the logic. It was impeccable. It was True. She couldn't force Issei to abandon Ren without breaking Issei's heart. And she couldn't erase Ren's memory without turning him into a defenseless victim. She lowered her hand. The magic faded.

Rias: "You... are a difficult human, Ren Nocturnus."
Ren: "I'm just honest."

Rias stood up, smoothing her skirt. She regained her composure, but the warmth was gone. It was replaced by the cold distance of a ruler dealing with a stubborn subject.

Rias: "Very well. You keep your memories. You keep your scars. But hear this command:"

She glared at him with her demonic power flaring slightly—an intimidation tactic.

Rias: "You are Civilian Support. You are Issei's friend, and nothing more. You do not engage Fallen Angels. You do not fight Stray Priests. If a battle starts, you run. If you try to play 'Warrior' again, I won't save you. I will prioritize my Peerage. Do you understand?"

Rias’s aura flared—a heavy, crimson pressure meant to intimidate a human into submission. She was drawing a line in the sand: We are Devils. You are fragile. Stay down. ​Ren didn't look down. He didn't flinch. He looked straight into the eyes of the High-Class Devil.

​Ren: "I understand your position, President. You have to protect your pieces."

​He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a calm, brutal whisper.

​Ren: "But don't give me orders I won't follow. If Issei is in danger, I'm stepping in. I don't care if it's a Fallen Angel or a Dragon."
​Rias: (Narrowing her eyes) "Then you will die. And I will not waste magic to resurrect you."
​Ren: "Deal."

​He said it without hesitation. Veritas. No bravado, just a statement of fact.

​Ren: "I never asked you to save me. If I'm too weak to survive, that's on me. But don't expect me to run away while my friends bleed. I'm not built that way."

​Rias stared at him. She expected gratitude or fear. She didn't expect a human to accept death as the price of friendship so casually. She realized she couldn't command him. He wasn't her subject.

​Rias: "You really are a fool, Ren Nocturnus."
​Ren: "Maybe. But I'm an honest one."
​Rias: "Fine. Do as you please. But when you break, don't look at me."

​She turned and walked out, the door clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the room.
Ren let out a breath he was holding. His hands were shaking—not from fear of Rias, but from the adrenaline of standing his ground against a Titan.

## 6.5 The Divergence (The Rotting Core)

Ren stared at the fruit basket.

Ren: "She thinks I'm suicidal. She doesn't understand. I'm not trying to die. I'm trying to matter."

He reached out with his left hand—the hand that had phased. He grabbed a bright red apple. He looked at it. It was vibrant, full of life. Like Issei. He felt the Envy curl in his gut.

Ren: "She accepts Issei's recklessness because he has power. She rejects mine because I don't."

He squeezed the apple. I am empty. You should be too.

Ren: "Wither."

The red skin turned grey instantly. The firm flesh collapsed, turning into a brown, mushy pulp under his fingers.

Ren: "It works... when I accept that I am alone."

He dropped the rotten mush into the trash can.

Ren: "If the Light won't protect me... then I'll walk in the Shadow."

📈 Status Update
 * Ren:
   * Status: Defiant. He rejected Rias's protection to keep his autonomy.
   * Self-Image: He knows he is "Less" than them physically, but refuses to be "Less" in spirit.
 * Relationship: A cold war has started between Ren and Rias. Issei is caught in the middle, unaware.

Here is the revised **Chapter 7**.

We focus on Ren's internal cultivation of the **Legend's concepts** (Energy, Sense, Will) without using the specific anime terms aloud, and establish his cold, logical indifference during the Riser incident.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 7: The Internal Circuit and The Indifferent Eye

**Timeline:** Friday Night $\rightarrow$ Tuesday Afternoon.
**Location:** Kuoh General Hospital / Ren's Apartment / The Clubroom.

## 7.1 The Internal Circuit (Friday Night)

The hospital room was quiet. Ren lay in the dark, his leg elevated. The pain was a dull throb, a constant noise in his nervous system.

**Ren:** "The Legends didn't just train muscles. They trained the flow inside."

He closed his eyes. He recalled the teachings of the Martial Arts masters from his library. *Relaxation. Body Awareness. Flow.* He didn't try to summon the Void. The Void was for destruction; he needed **Life** to heal. *Relax the toes. Relax the ankles. Feel the blood.* Ren visualized his body not as flesh, but as a map of pathways. He moved his "Body Awareness" away from the cold tips of his fingers and focused it entirely on the fracture in his femur. He tried to summon **Ki** (Life Energy). It was weak—a flickering candle compared to Issei's bonfire—but it was there.

**Ren's Thought:** *I can't cast a healing spell. But I can tell my cells to work harder. I can command my body to prioritize repair.*

He breathed deeply, cycling the air. He visualized the energy stitching the bone back together. He entered a trance state, hovering between sleep and extreme focus. The Void whispered to him, offering to *eat* the pain to make it stop, but Ren refused.

**Ren:** "No. I need to feel the pain. Pain tells me where the damage is. Pain is the roadmap."

By morning, the swelling had gone down significantly. His recovery speed was unnatural—not because of magic, but because of **Will** applied to biology.

## 7.2 The Synthesis of Will (The Weekend)

**Location:** Ren's Apartment.

Ren spent the weekend in isolation. He sat on his floor, surrounded by his notes. He looked at the potted plant he had withered with his touch. He needed to organize his understanding. He revered the **Legends**, and he needed to apply their logic to his strange new power.

**Ren's Analysis:**
* **Energy (Ki/Chi):** The fuel. He had very little.
* **Sense (Observation):** The ability to feel the presence of all things.
* **Will (Haki):** The ability to impose one's mind on reality.

He picked up a pencil. He looked at his left hand.
**Ren:** "The Legends use 'Armament' to strengthen objects with their energy and will. They make things harder, denser. They make a sword unbreakable."

He coated the pencil in his energy. But his energy was **Void**. The pencil didn't get harder. It got... **Darker**. It didn't become unbreakable; it became a conduit for entropy.

**Ren:** "My Will isn't 'Preservation.' My Will is 'Absence.' When I coat something, I don't strengthen its existence. I strengthen its ability to **erase** other things."

He stood up and began to move through his Martial Arts.
He practiced layering the concepts:
1.  **Sense:** Feel the empty space in the air.
2.  **Energy:** Flow the Ki to the fist.
3.  **Will (Armament):** Coat the fist in Void.
4.  **Will (Conqueror):** *Project* the intent. Command the target to fall.

He punched the air. A ripple of grey distortion followed his fist.
**Ren:** "The attack is strengthened by the Void (Armament). And the target is weakened by my command (Conqueror). It's a debuff. I don't hit harder; I make them softer."

He spent the weekend refining this. He wasn't just a brawler anymore; he was a technician of decay.

## 7.3 The Ghost in the Classroom (Monday)

Ren returned to school on crutches. The halls were buzzing with gossip about Issei and the "new hot transfer student" (Asia). Ren sat at his desk. He opened his textbook, but his mind was running combat simulations.

**Issei:** "Ren! You're back! Asia made bento!"

Ren looked up. He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes.
**Ren:** "Thanks, Issei. I'll eat later. I need to review these physics notes."

**Issei:** "Dude, are you okay? You seem... distant. The Perverted Trio needs its brain! We have to plan the peeping route for the pool!"

Ren looked at Issei. A week ago, the pool peeping plan would have been his priority.
Now? He felt nothing. The desire for the harem was gone, burned away by the need to survive. He saw Issei's aura—bright, chaotic, powerful. He felt his own—cold, quiet, precise.

**Ren:** "You guys go ahead. I have training to do."

**Asia:** (Walking over) "Ren-san! Are you okay? Does it hurt? I can heal it more if you like!" She raised her Twilight Healing rings, eager to be useful.

Ren gently pushed her hand away. Ren: "It's fine, Asia. It will be completely healed tonight. The bone is set."

Asia: "What do you mean? How? Without Sacred Gear?"

Ren: "Meditation. Circulation. The human body is pretty good at fixing itself if you tell it to."

Asia lowered her hands, looking a little dejected. Her role was "The Healer," but Ren had healed himself. Ren saw her expression. He softened slightly. Ren: "Save your mana for Issei. He gets hit more than I do."

He wasn't sulking. He was **Working**. While Issei was living a rom-com, Ren was mentally replaying the fight with Freed, correcting his mistakes. *I hesitated. I relied on sight. Next time, I rely on Sense.* After school Ren went straight home to fully focus on meditation, energy, and healing his legs.

## 7.4 The Indifferent Witness (Tuesday - Riser's Arrival)

**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

Ren was dragged to the clubroom by Issei.
**Issei:** "Come on, Ren! Rias wants everyone there! It's important!"

Ren stood in the corner, leaning on his crutches. He watched as the room filled with tension.
**Grayfia** arrived. **Riser Phenex** arrived with his harem.

**The Confrontation:**
Riser mocked the club. Riser groped Yubelluna to show off his "ownership."
**Issei:** "THAT'S NOT A HAREM! THAT'S SLAVERY!"
Issei raged. His Boosted Gear flared.

In the other timeline (Route A), Ariel stepped forward and punched the fire to protect Issei's dream. In this timeline, **Ren stood still.**

His **Sense (Observation)** was active. He watched Riser.
* **Analysis:** *Riser is arrogant. His guard is wide open. He relies entirely on regeneration (Immortality) and firepower. He has zero martial discipline. If I were stronger... I could slip a Void Strike into his ribs and rot his lung.*

Ren felt the urge to step in—the old urge to be a hero.
But then he looked at the board.
* **Rias:** High-Class Devil. Preparing a shield.
* **Akeno:** High-Class Devil. Preparing lightning.
* **Issei:** Dragon Host.
* **Ren:** Human. Broken leg.

**Ren's Logic (Veritas):** *If I step in, I am a liability. I force Rias to defend me instead of Issei. The most helpful thing I can do... is nothing.*

**Riser:** "Burn, trash!"
Riser threw the fireball at Issei. Rias blocked it easily. Issei challenged him.

Ren didn't flinch. He didn't gasp. He just **Watched**. He recorded Riser's attack speed. He recorded the density of the fire. He wasn't indifferent because he didn't care. He was indifferent because he was **Calculating**. His struggle to become stronger had overwritten his fear.

**Riser:** (Noticing Ren) "And who is the cripple in the corner? Another pet?"

The insult washed over Ren like water.
**Ren:** (Calmly) "No. Just an observer. I am just a human friend invited by Issei here."

Rias glanced at Ren, surprised by his lack of reaction. Usually, he would be angry on her behalf. Today, he was a statue.

**Riser:** "Hmph. Boring. Rias, I accept the game. Ten days."

Riser left. The Rating Game was set.

**Issei:** "I'm gonna kill him! Did you see that, Ren? He's a monster!"

Ren adjusted his crutch. His face was unreadable. **Ren:** "He's sloppy, Issei. He telegraphs his attacks. If you survive the first ten seconds, you can beat him."

**Rias:** "Ren... you aren't angry? He insulted you."

**Ren:** "What insult? It is true that I looked like a cripple. I'm wearing cast on my leg."

He turned to the door.
**Ren:** "I'm going home to train. Good luck with the camp."

He walked out. He didn't ask to go. He didn't beg to be included. He had his own war to fight, and it wasn't against Riser. It was against his own weakness. At home he fully meditated again and healed his legs.

***

Here is **Chapter 8**, crafted to reflect Ren's maturing perspective. He moves past simple envy into a profound, philosophical understanding of what it means to be "The Unchosen."

***

# 🌑 Chapter 8: The Silent Servant and The Weight of the World

**Timeline:** The Morning of Departure.
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom / Ren's Apartment / Gremory Villa.

## 8.0 The Pity Permit (The Clubroom Meeting)

An hour before going to Ren's house, the ORC was finalizing the logistics.

**Rias:** "We have the supplies. We have the transport. Is everyone ready?"

**Issei:** "Wait! Buchou... about Ren."

The room went quiet. Rias sighed, putting down her clipboard.
**Rias:** "Issei, we discussed this. Ren is human. Even if he has recovered physically, he has no magic resistance. The training we are doing involves high-density demonic energy. It is toxic for a civilian."

**Issei:** "But he saved Asia! He knows Riser's tactics better than anyone! We need him!"

**Kiba:** "Issei-kun, if he comes, we have to spend energy protecting him. In a 10-day crash course, we can't afford distractions."

**Akeno:** "He has spirit, but spirit doesn't stop explosions."

Issei looked desperate. He looked at Asia. Asia stepped forward, timid but determined.
**Asia:** "President... Ren-san is lonely. If we leave him behind now, after everything... I think he will drift away."

Rias looked at her Pawn and Bishop. She saw their emotional dependence on the human.
She rubbed her temples.
**Rias:** "Fine. But he cannot participate in combat training. He is not a fighter."

**Issei:** "He can cook! He makes amazing curry! He can clean the lodge! He won't be in the way, I promise!"

**Rias:** "A caretaker?" She considered it. "Having someone manage nutrition and maintenance would allow us to focus entirely on training... Very well. You may invite him. But make it clear: **He is Support Staff.** He is there to help you live, not to help you fight."

Issei clenched his fist. He hated that his friend was being reduced to a servant, but it was the only way to keep Ren involved.
**Issei:** "I'll go get him."

---

## 8.1 The Request (The Friend's Favor)

**Location:** Ren's Apartment.

Ren was packing his bag for school. He was moving fluidly, his leg fully healed thanks to his Ki cultivation. He looked sharp, calm, and detached.
*Knock. Knock.*

He opened the door. **Issei** and **Asia** stood there. Issei looked anxious; Asia looked hopeful.

**Issei:** "Ren... we're leaving for the mountains in an hour. For the training camp."

**Ren:** "I know. Good luck. Don't die."

**Issei:** "We want you to come."

Ren leaned against the doorframe. His expression didn't change.
**Ren:** "Issei, stop. Rias made it clear. I'm a civilian. Did you ask her?"

Issei flinched. He looked away.
**Issei:** "Yeah. We asked. She said... she said it's okay."

**Ren:** (Veritas) "What's the catch, Issei? Rias doesn't just change her mind."

**Issei:** "Well... she said you can come, but... you know, since you don't have magic... maybe you could help with the food? And the logistics?"

Ren went still.
He understood immediately. He wasn't being invited as a tactician. He wasn't being invited as a warrior. He was being hired as the help.

A week ago, this would have wounded his pride. He would have felt humiliated.
Now? He felt nothing but a quiet understanding.
*They are playing a game of Kings and Queens. They need someone to keep the board clean.*

**Asia:** "Please, Ren-san!" Asia stepped forward, sensing his hesitation. "It's not just about the food! When you are there... the room feels calmer. We are scared of Riser. Having our friend there... it makes us brave."

Ren looked at them. He saw the fear behind Issei’s bravado. He saw Asia’s trembling hands.
He realized that while he was "The Unchosen," he was still "The Friend."
He didn't need the glory. He didn't need the recognition. He just needed to make sure they didn't starve while saving the world.

**Ren:** "I won't be training with you. I'll just be the cook."

**Issei:** "That's fine! Just... be there? Please."

Ren nodded slowly. There was no bitterness in his face, only a calm acceptance of his role.
**Ren:** "Fine. I'll pack a bag. But I'm bringing my own books."

**Issei:** "Yes! Thanks, Ren! You won't regret it!"

Ren watched them run down the hall.
*I don't regret it,* he thought. *Friends ask for help. I help. That is the Truth.*


## 8.2 The View from the Kitchen (The Dignity of the Unchosen)

**Location:** The Gremory Villa. Day 3.

The mountains shook.
Outside, **Issei** was screaming as he unlocked the Boosted Gear. **Rias** was destroying cliffs with crimson energy. **Akeno** was painting the sky with lightning. It was a display of godlike, inherited power.

Inside, the kitchen was quiet. Ren stood at the sink, peeling potatoes. The water was cold. The knife was sharp. *Peel. Wash. Chop.*

A few days ago, this would have burned him with envy. He would have felt humiliated serving them. Now? He felt a strange, cold clarity.

He looked out the window at **Riser Phenex** (in his imagination/memory).
**Ren's Meditation:**
*Riser Phenex. Born a High-Class Devil. Immortal. Rich. Powerful.*
*Take away the Immortality. Take away the Fire. Take away the Peerage.*
*What is left?*

Ren sliced a potato cleanly in half. *A brat. A coward who screams when he bleeds.*

He looked at **Rias**. *Take away the Destruction Power. Take away the Gremory name.*
*She is strong willed, yes. But she relies on her power to solve problems.*

He looked at his own hands.
*Take away my... wait. I have nothing to take away.*
*I am already at zero.*

**Ren:** "The Great ones... they stand on pillars of gold. If the pillars break, they fall."

He looked at the maid staff of the Gremory house—humans and low-class devils working silently in the background, keeping the mansion running while the "Heroes" destroyed the forest.
**Ren:** "We are the ground. The ground doesn't fall. It endures."

He realized there was a beauty in being the **Unchosen**. The Unchosen have to build their own stairs. If Ren ever reached the top, no one could ever say he didn't earn it.

***

### 8.2.1 The Knight and The Shadow (Day 4 - Afternoon)

Kiba sat on the porch, wiping sweat from his brow. He had been practicing his high-speed movement for four hours. His swords lay scattered on the grass.

Ren walked out with a tray of cold barley tea. He placed it silently next to Kiba.

**Kiba:** "Thanks, Ren. You always know exactly when we need a break."

**Ren:** "I watch. It's what I do."

Kiba took a sip, looking at his swords. "I'm not fast enough yet. Riser's Knight moves like the wind. I need to be faster."

Ren picked up an empty glass. He looked at Kiba. He saw the Holy Sword user’s desperate need for speed, driven by his tragic past.
**Ren:** "You're fast, Kiba. But you're loud."

**Kiba:** "Loud?"

**Ren:** "Not sound. Intent. When you move, you scream 'I am attacking.' It makes you easy to track."

Ren poured more tea. The liquid flowed smoothly, without a splash.
**Ren:** "The wind is fast, but it pushes against the air. Vacuum is faster because it has no resistance. Maybe stop trying to cut the air, and try to slip through it."

Kiba stared at him. It was profound advice from a guy wearing an apron.
**Kiba:** "Slip through... like a shadow?"

**Ren:** "Sure. Like a shadow."
Ren stood up to leave.
**Ren:** "But what do I know? I'm just the guy who cuts the vegetables."

Kiba watched him go. He felt a strange chill. Ren felt... *quiet*. Not just silent, but *absent*.

### 8.2.2 The Rook and The Weight (Day 5 - Morning)

Supplies were running low. Ren had to hike down to the nearest road to pick up a delivery of food. The boxes were heavy.
**Koneko** walked with him. She carried four crates stacked on top of each other. Ren struggled with one.

**Koneko:** "Give it to me. You're struggling."

Ren adjusted his grip. His leg brace creaked.
**Ren:** "I've got it, Koneko-chan. You carry the team. I can carry the carrots."

Koneko slowed her pace to match his limp. She sniffed the air. She frowned.
**Koneko:** "You smell weird."

**Ren:** "Is it the curry spices?"

**Koneko:** "No. You smell like... nothing. Like a room with no windows."

Ren smiled. It was a polite, hollow smile.
**Ren:** "That's probably just the detergent I used. Keep moving, Rook. Issei gets cranky if lunch is late."

Koneko watched him out of the corner of her eye. Usually, humans smelled of sweat, fear, or desire. Ren used to smell like envy. Now, he smelled like cold air. It bothered her, but she respected that he didn't complain about the weight.

### 8.2.3 The Queen and The Wall (Day 6 - Evening)

The kitchen was a mess after dinner. Ren was washing dishes.
**Akeno** leaned against the counter, watching him. She enjoyed teasing the boys, and Ren used to be an easy target—blushing and stuttering.

**Akeno:** "Ara ara, Ren-kun. You look quite domestic in that apron. Does it make you feel... submissive?"

She trailed a finger down his arm.
Ren didn't flinch. He didn't blush. He didn't drop the plate.
He continued scrubbing a pot.

**Ren:** "It makes me feel efficient, Akeno-san. Grease is stubborn."

Akeno blinked. The reaction—or lack thereof—threw her off.
**Akeno:** "You're no fun anymore. You used to turn so red."

Ren rinsed the pot. He looked at her reflection in the dark window.
**Ren:** "I was a kid back then. Kids get embarrassed. Adults get the job done."

He turned to her, drying his hands. His eyes were clear and completely devoid of lust.
**Ren:** "Was there something else? Or are you just bored because Issei is asleep?"

Akeno straightened up, her playful mask slipping for a second. She felt a shiver. It wasn't fear, exactly. It was the feeling of talking to a mannequin that was pretending to be a person.
**Akeno:** "No. Nothing else. Goodnight, Ren-kun."

**Ren:** "Goodnight."

### 8.2.4 The King's Oversight (Day 8 - Assessment)

**Rias** entered the kitchen with a clipboard. She was in full "Commander" mode.
**Rias:** "Ren, status report on provisions."

**Ren:** "We have enough for three more days. I rationed the high-protein items for Issei and Kiba. I prepared light, high-energy meals for you and Akeno to aid mana recovery."

Rias nodded, pleased.
**Rias:** "Excellent work. You truly are a reliable support. I knew bringing you was the right choice. It keeps Issei calm."

**Ren:** "Glad to be of service, President."

**Rias:** "How is your leg?"

**Ren:** "It holds."

Rias smiled—a benevolent, queenly smile. She reached out and patted his shoulder.
**Rias:** "When this is over, I'll make sure you get a nice bonus. Maybe a vacation?"

Ren looked at her hand on his shoulder. He felt the warmth of her Devil power. It felt alien.
**Ren:** "A vacation sounds nice. Somewhere quiet."

**Rias:** "You've earned it. Carry on."

She left, confident that her human pet was happy.
Ren stared at the spot where she touched him. He wiped it off, as if dusting away a cobweb.

**Ren:** "A bonus. She thinks she can pay for loyalty."

He turned back to the stove. The fire reflected in his dead eyes.
**Ren:** "I don't want a vacation, Rias. I want an exit."

You are absolutely right. The **Asia interaction** is critical because she is the other "Outsider" who was brought in, and the **Group Gathering** is essential to show the stark contrast between the "Main Cast" and the "Support."

Here are the missing scenes to complete **Chapter 8**, inserted before the final night.

***

### 8.2.5 The Saint and The Sinner (Day 7 - Midday)

Asia found Ren behind the villa, chopping wood for the fire. He wasn't using an axe. He was testing his **Void Armament** (Dampening) on the logs, causing them to split silently along the grain. He stopped immediately when he felt her approach.

**Asia:** "Ren-san? Are you hurt?"

She hurried over, her Twilight Healing ring glowing soft green. She reached for his hand—the one that had been glowing grey a moment ago.

Ren pulled his hand back sharply.
**Ren:** "Don't touch it, Asia."

**Asia:** "But... you were wincing. Is it your leg?"

**Ren:** "My leg is fine. It's just... cold hands. You know how it is."

Asia looked at him. Her eyes were pure, incapable of suspicion.
**Asia:** "You are working so hard for us. Cooking, cleaning... I feel bad that you cannot train with Issei-san."

Ren sat on a log. He gestured for her to sit on the other one.
**Ren:** "Don't feel bad. Issei is building a tower. I'm pouring the concrete. Both are necessary."

**Asia:** "But... don't you want to climb the tower too?"

Ren looked at the sky.
**Ren:** "I tried climbing, Asia. I fell. Now, I think I prefer the ground. It's stable."

Asia sensed the deep, hollow sadness in his voice. She didn't understand it, but she wanted to fill it.
**Asia:** "Ren-san... I am happy you are here. Even if you don't fight. When I was in the church, I was alone. Having you here... it makes this place feel like a home, not a barracks."

Ren looked at her. He smiled, and this time, it reached his eyes.
**Ren:** "Thanks, Asia. That... actually helps."

**Asia:** "I will pray for you, Ren-san. I will pray that you find your own tower."

Ren’s smile faded slightly as she turned to leave.
**Ren:** (Whispering) "Don't pray for me, Asia. The things listening to me aren't holy."

### 8.2.6 The Last Supper and The Flash (Day 9 - Evening)

The final night before they returned to Kuoh. The training was done. Rias declared a celebration.
They gathered in the courtyard for a BBQ.

**The Scene:**
* **Issei** was fighting Kiba over the last beef rib.
* **Koneko** was silently eating an entire mountain of corn.
* **Akeno** and **Rias** were drinking wine, laughing at the boys.
* **Asia** was clapping happily.

Ren was at the grill. He was covered in soot and sauce. He wasn't eating. He was serving.
**Issei:** "Ren! Come sit! Stop cooking!"

**Ren:** "Someone has to watch the fire, Issei. Or the meat burns."

He watched them eat. He felt a wall of glass between him and the table. They were glowing with magical energy, vibrant and immortal. He felt grey and finite.

**Rias:** "Everyone! Group photo! We need to remember this training camp."

They scrambled together. Issei stood in the middle, grabbing Rias and Asia. Akeno leaned on Kiba. Koneko stood in front.
**Issei:** "Ren! Get in here!"

Ren wiped his hands on his apron. He walked over.
He stepped into the frame next to Issei.
But as Akeno set up the magic camera timer, the grill flared up behind them. A grease fire.

**Ren:** "The steak!"

Ren turned around and ran back to the grill to save the food.
*CLICK.*
The camera flashed.

**The Result:**
The photo developed instantly on a magical sheet.
It showed the Gremory Peerage, smiling, radiant, beautiful.
And in the background, a blurry, out-of-focus figure of Ren, back turned, fighting a fire alone.

**Issei:** "Aw man! We missed you, Ren!"

**Rias:** "We can take another one."

Ren looked at the photo. He saw the composition. It was perfect. The Heroes in the light. The Servant in the background.
**Ren:** "No. It's perfect. That's exactly how it should be."

**Issei:** "What? But you're barely in it!"

**Ren:** "I'm there, Issei. I'm keeping the fire from burning the house down."

He pinned the photo to the fridge. He stared at it for a long time.
**Ren's Thought:** *This is my place. The blur in the background. The ghost in the machine.*

That night, while they slept, he went into the woods and opened the **Corridor of Darkness** for the first time (as written in Section 3). The photo had confirmed what his heart already knew: **He was not part of the picture.**

***

## 8.3 The Daily Grind: The Invisible Dojo

**Concept:** Ren turns the mundane tasks of a servant into high-level martial arts conditioning. He hides his training in plain sight.

### ☀️ Morning: The Water Carrier (05:00 AM)
**Task:** Filling the water barrels from the mountain stream.
**Training Focus:** **Void Step & Grip Strength.**

Ren carried two massive wooden buckets of water up the steep, muddy trail. They weighed 40kg each. Issei was doing a similar drill with tires, screaming and stomping.
Ren moved in silence.

**Ren's Internal Monologue:**
*If I spill a drop, I fail. If I make a sound, I fail.*

He practiced **Void Step** (Stealth Movement). He forced his foot to find the "dead space" on the ground—the patch of dirt that wouldn't crunch. He adjusted his center of gravity with every step, making the heavy buckets feel weightless by flowing *with* gravity rather than fighting it.

When his grip began to slip, he didn't adjust. He channeled **Void Dampening** into his fingertips. The friction increased. His hands became sticky shadows, locking onto the wood handles.
**Ren:** "Don't let go. Even if the skin tears."

### ☀️ Midday: The Butcher's Block (11:00 AM)
**Task:** Preparing lunch for 6 people (High caloric needs).
**Training Focus:** **Control & Precision.**

Ren stood at the counter with a chef's knife. He had to chop a mountain of vegetables.
He didn't just chop. He practiced **Intent Sensing**.

He closed his eyes. He sensed the "structure" of the carrot. He felt the grain.
*Slash.*
Perfect julienne slices.

**The Challenge:**
He activated a microscopic layer of **Void Decay** on his fingertips—just enough to turn the air grey.
**Ren's Goal:** *Hold the knife with the Decay active, but do not let it touch the food. If the food rots, I fail.*

It was a test of absolute containment. He had to keep his darkness leashed while performing high-speed manual labor. Sweat poured down his face.
**Issei:** "Whoa, Ren! You're chopping so fast I can't see the blade!"
**Ren:** "Just efficient, Issei."
*(He looked at the carrot. It was pristine. He hadn't rotted it. Success.)*

### ☀️ Afternoon: The Laundry Guard (02:00 PM)
**Task:** Hanging sheets and washing training gear.
**Training Focus:** **Observation (Gap Detection).**

While the sheets dried in the wind, obstructing the view of the courtyard, Ren stood behind them.
He watched the shadows of Kiba and Issei sparring on the other side of the white fabric.

He couldn't see them. He could only see their shadows and feel their intent.
**Ren's Training:** *Predict the hit.*

He was "Shadow Boxing" with the strongest fighters in the room without them knowing. He analyzed Kiba's speed. He analyzed Issei's power.
**Ren:** "Kiba telegraphs his elbow before a thrust. Issei overcommits on the overhead."

He cataloged their weaknesses. Not to hurt them, but because he needed to know he *could*.

### ☀️ Evening: The Floor Scrub (05:00 PM)
**Task:** Cleaning the mud from the hallway.
**Training Focus:** **Core Tension & Armament Structure.**

Ren was on his hands and knees, scrubbing. It looked pathetic.
In reality, he was holding a **Plank**. He kept his core locked tight, harder than iron.
Every scrub motion was a **Parry Motion**.
*Wax on (Deflect).*
*Wax off (Absorb).*

He visualized Riser's fire. He scrubbed the floor with the intent to **wipe away existence**.
The wood of the floor didn't just get clean; it got polished to a mirror shine because Ren was applying inhuman, consistent pressure.

**Rias:** (Walking by) " The floor looks wonderful, Ren. You're very thorough."
**Ren:** "A clean foundation is important, President."
*(He was sweating profusely, his abs screaming in agony, but his voice was steady.)*

***

## 8.4 The Nightwalker (Cultivation of the Void)

**Time:** 2:00 AM.

The Devils slept, exhausted by their mana expenditure.
Ren was awake. He walked into the deep woods, far away from the villa’s wards.
He didn't scream. He didn't punch trees in anger.

He found a clearing. He sat down in the lotus position.
He closed his eyes and expanded his **Sense**.

He felt the sleeping forest.
He felt the ants marching in the dirt. They weren't chosen. They worked until they died.
He felt the wind eroding the stone. The wind wasn't special. It just never stopped.

**Ren:** "I am the Ant. I am the Wind."

He began his breathing exercises. **Bio-Feedback.**
*Inhale the Silence. Exhale the Noise.*

He visualized his **Void**.
It wasn't a weapon anymore. It wasn't a "Rotting Fist" meant to hurt thugs.
It was a **Space**.
A vast, empty room in his soul where he could put things he didn't need.
*Jealousy? Put it in the Void.*
*Fear? Put it in the Void.*
*Pain? Put it in the Void.*

As he emptied himself of these emotions, his connection to the **Darkness** deepened. It stopped being volatile. It became smooth. Liquid.

**Ren:** "If I am nothing... then I can be anything."

He stood up. He moved through his martial arts. Slowly. Deliberately. He didn't use force. He moved *through* the air, seeking the path of least resistance. When he punched, he didn't try to break reality. He tried to **Phase** through it. His hand flickered. For a second, his arm became a blur of grey static. He wasn't forcing the glitch. He was **allowing** it.

## 8.5 The Glimpse of the Door

As Ren finished his moves, the atmosphere shifted. The shadows under the trees seemed to stretch toward him. They weren't hostile. They were... affectionate. They swirled around his feet like a cat greeting its owner.

Ren looked down. The shadows pooled together. They darkened until they were blacker than the night itself. In the center of the pool, a vertical slit opened. A hum resonated in his bones. A low, abyssal vibration.

**Ren:** "The Corridor."

He knew what it was instantly. The archives of the Legends spoke of it. The path between worlds. The place where negative energy flowed like a river. To Rias, it would be poison. To Issei, it would be terror.

To Ren, it looked like a **Door**.

He reached out his hand. He felt the cold draft coming from the rift. It smelled of ozone and ancient dust. He knew he could step in. He knew if he did, he might gain power that would make Riser look like a joke. But he pulled his hand back.

**Ren:** "Not yet."

He looked back toward the Villa.
**Ren:** "They asked me to stay. I promised I'd make breakfast."

He wasn't staying because he was scared. He was staying because **Veritas** meant keeping your word. He told Issei he would be there. He dismissed the portal. The shadows dispersed.

**Ren:** "I know where you are now. I'll come back when I'm ready to leave the sun behind."

## 8.5 The Morning Service

**Time:** 6:00 AM.

Ren was in the kitchen. The curry was simmering.
Issei stumbled in, groggy and sore.
**Issei:** "Morning, Ren. That smells amazing."

**Ren:** "Morning, Issei. Eat up. You have a long day."

Issei looked at Ren. He noticed something different. Ren wasn't looking at the floor. He wasn't glaring at the wall. He was calm. Unnervingly calm.

**Issei:** "You okay, man? You seem... different."

Ren smiled. It wasn't a happy smile, but it was a real one.
**Ren:** "I'm fine, Issei. I just realized that someone has to peel the potatoes while you save the world. It’s an honest job."

Issei laughed, clapping him on the back. "You're the best, Ren! We couldn't do this without you!"

Ren watched Issei eat.
*You could,* Ren thought. *But you don't want to. That's why I'm still here.*

Ren served the food. He cleaned the plates. He watched them train.
He was the Shadow in the corner of the room. Not hiding anymore. Just waiting.

## 📈 Status Update

* **Ren:**
    * **Mental State:** **Acceptance (Sage Foundation).** He has accepted the unfairness of the world and found dignity in endurance.
    * **Ability:** **Void Meditation** mastered. **Corridor of Darkness** unlocked (but sealed by choice).
    * **Relationship:** He is playing the role of the "Friend" perfectly, but his soul has already packed its bags.

You are absolutely right. If Ren achieved a state of **"Acceptance"** and **"Dignity of the Unchosen"** in Chapter 8, he wouldn't be screaming or banging on the glass in panic.

Instead, his reaction should be **Cold, Analytical, and Resigned.**

He shouldn't be the "desperate friend trying to save them"; he should be the **"Cassandra"**—the one who sees the future, speaks the truth, is ignored, and watches the tragedy happen with a terrifying calmness. This makes the rejection by Sirzechs even more poignant: Ren isn't silenced because he's loud/annoying; he is silenced because he is **Right but Low-Status**.

Here is the **Revised Chapter 9**, reflecting Ren’s enlightened, detached state.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 9: The Silent Witness and The Broken Glass

**Timeline:** The Rating Game (Sunday).
**Location:** The Observation Room (VIP Box).

## 9.1 The Professional Observer

Ren stood in the corner of the Observation Room. He didn't fidget. He didn't look nervous. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, posture perfect, watching the screens with the eyes of a veteran general.

The room was filled with High-Class Devils sipping wine. **Sirzechs Lucifer** sat on the throne. **Grayfia** manned the controls.
Ren felt the immense pressure of their auras, but he let it flow through him.
*I am the Void. Pressure cannot crush what isn't there.*

On the screens, the battle raged. Rias was playing aggressively, pushing her power.
Ren’s **Void Sense** (projected through the cameras/screens via his focus) saw what Rias missed.

## 9.2 The Quiet Warning (Veritas)

Ren saw **Riser’s Queen (Yubelluna)** planting the magic mines in the clouds. It wasn't a subtle trap to Ren; it was a glaring neon sign.

**Ren:** "President."

His voice was calm, cutting through the ambient noise of the room. He walked to the console.

**Ren:** "Akeno-san is flying into a saturation zone. Sector 4 is rigged with delayed-blast magic."

**Rias (Comms):** *"Ren? I'm busy commanding. Akeno knows what she's doing."*

**Ren:** "She is provoking Yubelluna. She isn't watching the atmospheric density. If she enters that cloud bank, she will be retired."

Ren reached for the tactical override button—not to command, but to send a "Hazmat Warning" ping.

**Sirzechs:** "Stop."

The Satan didn't raise his voice. He didn't unleash a crushing aura. He simply spoke a command.
Ren stopped. His hand hovered an inch from the button. He looked at Sirzechs.

**Sirzechs:** "The King must learn from her mistakes. If you save her from every error, she will never grow."

Ren looked at Sirzechs. He saw the logic of a God: *Suffering is a lesson.*
Ren saw the logic of a Human: *Suffering is pain.*

**Ren:** "She will lose her Queen, Lucifer-sama. It is a mathematical certainty."

**Sirzechs:** "Then she loses."

Ren stared at the Devil King. He didn't argue. He didn't scream. He withdrew his hand and stepped back to the wall.
**Ren:** "Understood. Lesson in progress."

On the screen, **Akeno** flew into the clouds.
*BOOM.*
The explosion was massive. Akeno plummeted, wings shredded.
**Grayfia:** *[Gremory Queen, Retired.]*

Rias screamed over the comms.
Ren watched Akeno fall. He didn't flinch. He just nodded once.
*Fact confirmed.*

## 9.3 The Analysis of Failure

The game fell apart. Without the "Efficiency" training, **Kiba** ran out of stamina. **Koneko** was overwhelmed. Ren watched it all with the detachment of a coroner performing an autopsy.

* *Kiba: Too much emotion. Wasted movement.*
* *Koneko: Too stubborn. Took damage she didn't need to.*
* *Rias: Panicking. Losing command cohesion.*

He wasn't angry at them. He felt a deep, melancholic **Pity**.
**Ren's Thought:** *They have so much power. So much light. But they are blind to the shadows.*

## 9.4 The Martyrdom of the Pawn

It came down to **Issei**. Issei was beaten bloody by Riser. He kept standing up, screaming about his promise to Rias. The Devils in the VIP room cheered. "Look at that spirit!" "What a brave Pawn!"

Ren felt the **Envy** try to rise, but he drowned it in the Void.
**Ren:** "They cheer for him because he bleeds. They love a tragedy."

Issei unlocked the **Balance Breaker** (Imperfect). He punched Riser. He used the Holy Water. Riser screamed. Issei collapsed. Riser regenerated.

**Riser:** "I win."

Rias surrendered.
**Grayfia:** *[Winner: Riser Phenex.]*

The room erupted in polite applause. Ren looked at Issei’s broken body on the screen.
He realized the difference between them. *Issei fights to be seen. I fight to survive.*

## 9.5. The Verdict of the Unchosen

Ren walked toward the exit.
**Sirzechs:** "You saw the traps before my sister did. You have excellent eyes, boy."

Ren stopped. He didn't turn around.
**Ren:** "Eyes are useless if the King covers them."

**Sirzechs:** "Perhaps. But today, Rias learned the cost of arrogance. That is worth the loss."

Ren looked at his hand—the hand that could rot matter.
**Ren:** "You sacrifice pieces to teach lessons. I don't."

He walked out. He didn't slam the door. He closed it gently. The silence he left behind was heavier than any scream.

---

### 📈 Status Update

* **Ren:**
    * **Mental State:** **Cold Clarity.** He realizes the "System" of Devils is incompatible with his "Veritas." They treat war like a game/lesson. He treats it like life or death.
    * **Relationship:** He feels completely disconnected from the Gremory leadership (Sirzechs/Rias). He feels pity for Issei.
* **The Plot:** Rias is taken. The Aftermath awaits.

This chapter is the turning point where Ren’s power stops being a "cool secret" and becomes a source of horror for those around him. He saves them, but in a way that widens the gap between him and the "Heroes."

Here is **Chapter 10: The Shadow Eater**.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 10: The Shadow Eater

**Timeline:** Monday Afternoon (The Day After the Defeat).
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

## 10.1 The Funeral for a Dream

The clubroom was suffocatingly quiet. **Issei** lay on the sofa, wrapped in bandages, unconscious. He had burned his life force to use the Balance Breaker for ten seconds. **Rias** sat by his side, holding his hand. She wasn't crying anymore. She looked hollow. **Asia**, **Kiba**, and **Koneko** sat in silence, nursing their own injuries. They had fought, and they had lost. **Ren** stood by the window. He wasn't injured. He hadn't fought. He was the only one in the room who was "whole," yet he felt like he was missing more than any of them.

**Ren's Internal Monologue:**
*They look like a tragic painting. The fallen heroes. And I'm just the guy in the background who watched it happen.* He looked at his hands. He felt the **Void** pulsing under his skin, hungry and agitated. It hated the atmosphere of defeat. It wanted to *consume* the sadness.

## 10.2 The Victor's Arrival

The magic circle flared in the center of the room. It wasn't the gentle crimson of Gremory; it was the violent, arrogant orange of Phenex. **Riser Phenex** stepped out. He was pristine. His suit was pressed. He held a bouquet of red roses.

**Riser:** "Rias. My beloved. Stop mourning the Pawn. It’s time to go."

**Rias:** "Give me... a moment."

**Riser:** "No moments. The engagement is absolute. You lost."
Riser looked around the room, sneering at the defeated peerage.
**Riser:** "Look at them. Broken toys. Especially him."

He pointed at **Issei**.
**Riser:** "He annoyed me. He touched my face. I think... I’ll take his arm as a souvenir. A lesson for the next Pawn who thinks he can challenge a God."

Riser formed a blade of condensed **Hellfire**. He walked toward the unconscious Issei.

**Asia:** "No! Please!"
**Kiba:** (Trying to stand, collapsing) "Stop..."

Rias stood up to block him, but she was drained of magic. Riser simply pushed her aside with a wave of wind pressure.
**Riser:** "Stay down, wife. Let me clean up the trash."

## 10.3 The Garbage Disposal

Ren watched Rias fall. He watched Issei sleeping, defenseless. He didn't feel anger. He didn't feel "Burning Spirit." He felt **Disgust**.

**Ren:** *He won. He has the girl. He has the power. And he still kicks the dog.*

Ren moved. He didn't use **Burst Speed**. He used **Void Step**—sliding through the blind spot in Riser's peripheral vision. He didn't run; he simply *arrived* between Riser and Issei.

**Riser:** "You again? The cripple?"
Riser thrust the fire blade at Ren’s chest. "Die, insect."

**Ren:** *Don't block. Accept.*

Ren opened his arms.
**[Technique: Void Gluttony]**

*FWOOSH.*

The blade of hellfire stabbed into Ren’s chest. But flesh didn't burn. There was no smell of cooking meat. Instead, the fire turned **Black**. Ren inhaled sharply. His veins bulged, turning dark violet. He wasn't blocking the fire; he was **drinking** it. He opened the emptiness inside his soul—the envy, the rejection, the solitude—and used it as a vacuum.

**Ren:** (Gasping) "Your fire... tastes like ash."

The blade dissolved, sucked entirely into Ren’s body. Riser stared, his hand empty. "What... what did you do? That was condensed plasma!"

## 10.4 The Touch of Entropy

Ren stumbled forward. The fire was burning him from the inside, but the Void was suffocating it. Smoke poured from his mouth and nose. He grabbed Riser’s wrist with his left hand. His grip was like a vice made of ice.

**Ren:** "You talk too much."

He didn't punch. He didn't use martial arts. He headbutted Riser. But right before impact, he coated his forehead in **Void Decay**.

*THUD.*

It wasn't a hard hit. But the moment skin touched skin, the **Rot** transferred. A patch of grey necrosis spread instantly across Riser’s nose and cheek. The immortal flesh withered, cells dying faster than they could regenerate.

**Riser:** "GAH!"
Riser stumbled back, clutching his face.
**Riser:** "IT BURNS! IT'S COLD! WHY ISN'T IT HEALING?!"

**Ren:** "Because I rejected it."

Ren coughed, spitting up black bile (the residue of the fire). He looked like a ghoul.
He stepped toward Riser. The shadows in the room stretched toward Ren, darkening the lights.

**Ren:** "You want to be a God? Gods don't rot. You're just meat."

## 10.5 The Horror of the Light

Riser backed away, genuine terror in his eyes. He fired a blast of wind magic. Ren didn't dodge. He swiped his hand, and the wind **phased** through him, disrupted by his glitching existence. Ren raised his hand to finish it. He was going to rot Riser's throat.

**Sirzechs Lucifer** (Hologram) appeared.
**Sirzechs:** "That is enough."

A wave of Power of Destruction gently pushed Ren back. Ren didn't fight it. He let himself slide across the floor, hitting the wall. He slumped down, shivering violently as his body tried to process the toxic magic he had eaten. Riser scrambled back, his face slowly, painfully healing as the rot faded.

**Riser:** "That *thing*... it tried to eat my existence! Keep it away from me!"

Riser grabbed Rias's arm.
**Riser:** "We are leaving! This place is cursed!"

He teleported away, taking Rias with him. The room was silent.

## 10.6 The Verdict

Issei groaned, waking up.
**Issei:** "Buchou...?"

He looked around. Rias was gone. He saw the other members looking at the corner. Ren was curled up against the wall, wiping black sludge from his mouth. His eyes were dull and hollow.

**Issei:** "Ren? Are you okay? What happened?"

**Kiba:** (Whispering) "He... he absorbed the fire. He rotted Riser's face."

Issei crawled off the sofa. He went to Ren.
**Issei:** "Ren! You saved me again!"

Ren looked up. Issei expected to see a hero. Instead, he saw a boy who looked like he wanted to die.

**Ren:** "I didn't save you, Issei. I just... cleaned up the mess."

Ren stood up, using the wall for support. His aura felt jagged and wrong. It made Asia shiver instinctively.
**Ren:** "I'm not a knight. I'm a garbage disposal. I eat the things you can't handle."

He pushed past Issei.
**Issei:** "Where are you going?"

**Ren:** "To wash the taste of him out of my mouth."

He walked out of the clubroom. Issei watched him go. For the first time, he felt scared of his best friend. Not because Ren was dangerous, but because Ren looked **empty**.

---

### 📈 Status Update

* **Ren:**
    * **Ability:** **Void Gluttony** (Absorption) confirmed. High recoil (internal damage/nausea). **Decay** confirmed to work on Immortals (temporarily).
    * **Self-Image:** Total degradation. He views his power as disgusting and vile.
* **The Plot:** Rias is gone. The Wedding is in 3 days. The "Training/Prep" gap begins.

# **📝 Acknowledgement**

Here is the sequence connecting the aftermath to the final preparations. We start with the Grayfia interaction to cement the stakes, then move into **Chapter 11**, where Ren enters the Corridor for the first time to bridge the power gap.

Regarding the **Corridor of Darkness Time Dilation**:
To make Ren strong enough to fight a Peerage in just 3 days, but not age him into an old man yet, we will use a **Hyperbolic** ratio.
* **Ratio:** **1 Hour (Real World) = 1 Week (Corridor).**
* **Constraint:** The Corridor is toxic. Staying too long corrodes the soul. Ren can only survive short dives right now.
* **The Plan:** He will dive for **3 Hours** each night. That gives him roughly **21 Weeks (5 Months)** of subjective training time before the Wedding.

***

# 🌑 Interlude: The Queen and The Heretic

**Timeline:** Monday Night.
**Location:** The Park (Ren's Training Spot).

Ren was washing the black sludge off his face in the public fountain. He looked up into the mirror of the water. His reflection looked tired.

"You possess a dangerous ability, human."

Ren didn't jump. His **Void Sense** had felt the chill in the air seconds ago. He turned around. **Grayfia Lucifuge** stood under the streetlight. She wasn't wearing her maid uniform; she wore a formal battle coat.

**Ren:** "Lucifuge-sama. Are you here to execute me?"

**Grayfia:** "No. Sirzechs was... impressed. You consumed High-Class magic without dying. That is not a human feat. That is a monster's feat."

She walked closer.
**Grayfia:** "I came to warn you. The power you used... it is not 'Demonic.' It is **Anti-Existence**. If you continue to let it eat magic, it will eventually eat you."

**Ren:** (Veritas) "I know. It tastes like rot. But it's the only weapon I have."

**Grayfia:** "Why go so far? Issei Hyoudou fights for love. What do you fight for?"

**Ren:** "I fight because I refuse to be the victim."

Grayfia studied him. She reached into her coat and pulled out a small vial—**Phoenix Tears**.
**Grayfia:** "A gift. For saving Rias's dignity. If that darkness ever tries to consume your heart... drink this. It might buy you a few minutes."

She placed it on the bench.
**Grayfia:** "Do not come to the wedding, Ren Nocturnus. The Underworld is not kind to anomalies."

She vanished in silver light. Ren picked up the vial.
**Ren:** "I'm not coming as a guest, Grayfia. I'm coming as a disaster."

***

This is a grounded and logical adjustment. It keeps Ren's power scaling consistent. He isn't suddenly Garp or Goku in three days; he is **Big Boss** or **John Wick** with the power of the Void. He is a "Super-Soldier of Darkness."

The high-fantasy stuff (Haki, Ki Blasts, World Destruction) is his **Long Term Goal**, to be mastered during his exile. For the Wedding, he relies on **Tactics + Decay**.

Here is the **Revised Chapter 11**.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 11: The Dark Soldier and The Silent Clock

**Timeline:** Tuesday - Thursday (The 3-Day Gap).
**Location:** Ren's Apartment / **The Corridor of Darkness**.

## 11.1 The Inventory of the Weak (Tuesday Night)

Ren sat in his apartment. He looked at the posters of Goku and Luffy.
He reached out and gently took them down, rolling them up.

**Ren:** "Not yet. I can't punch a planet. I can't split the sky. If I try to be Garp now, I'll just break my hand again."

He replaced the posters with his own hand-drawn diagrams: **Anatomy Charts**, **CQC Stances**, and **Guerrilla Tactics**.
He looked at his tools: The Heavy-Duty Utility Knife. The Steel Pipe. The Duct Tape.

**Ren:** "I am not a God. I am a Soldier. I am the **Weak Hero**."

He accessed the **"Soldier"** section of his mental library.
* **Gray Yeon (Weak Hero):** *Use the environment. Fight dirty. Aim for the weak points.*
* **Ijin Yu (Mercenary Enrollment):** *Efficiency. One strike, one kill. No wasted movement.*
* **Solid Snake (MGS):** *Stealth. Infiltration. The element of surprise.*

**Ren:** "The Darkness doesn't replace these. It **upgrades** them."

## 11.2 The Bootcamp in the Abyss (The Grind)

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlrIVYfeiWc" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 71. Lost in Darkness" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8HlZuCtf5I" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 72. Shattered Hope" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Ren opened the **Corridor of Darkness**.
**Time Dilation:** 1 Hour Real = 1 Week Void.
**Goal:** Integrate the **Void** into his **Soldier and Martial Arts**.

He stepped inside. The gravity hit him, but he stood tall. He didn't try to fire energy beams. He practiced **Killing**.

### A. The Void Knife (Mercenary Style)
**Original Tech:** Knife Fighting (Reverse Grip).
**The Upgrade:** **Void Decay.**

Ren practiced with his utility knife against shadow-constructs.
* *Strike:* He slashed the jugular.
* *Infusion:* He pulsed the Void through the blade at the moment of contact.
* *Result:* The blade didn't just cut; it left a trail of necrosis. It prevented clotting. It numbed the nerves so the enemy wouldn't feel the cut until they collapsed from blood loss.

**Ren:** "A cut heals. Rot spreads."

### B. The Shadow Bind (Weak Hero Style)
**Original Tech:** Using belts, curtains, or clothing to tangle an opponent.
**The Upgrade:** **Shadow Materialization.**

Ren practiced **Dirty Fighting**. He visualized the shadows on the floor as tripwires.
* *Drill:* He stomped the ground. The shadow shot up like a whip, wrapping around the target's ankle.
* *Follow up:* While the target stumbled, Ren moved in for the CQC takedown.

**Ren:** "I don't need super strength to hold them down. I just need them to trip."

### C. The Ghost Walk (MGS Style)
**Original Tech:** Stealth walking. Silent footsteps.
**The Upgrade:** **Phase Shift (Glitch).**

Ren ran through the dark landscape. He practiced timing his **Phase Shift** to the exact moment his foot touched the ground.
* *Result:* Absolute silence. No vibration. No sound. He was passing *through* the floor for a micro-second with every step.
* *Defense:* He practiced phasing *only* his vital organs when attacked. Not a full body phase (too draining), but just "glitching" his heart or his brain out of reality for a split second.

## 11.3 The Review of the Legends (Thursday Morning)

Ren emerged from the Corridor on the final morning. He was exhausted, his skin pale, his eyes sharp as broken glass.
He sat on his floor. He didn't meditate on "Nothingness." He meditated on **Application**.

He reviewed his internal "Library," acknowledging what he was leaving for later.

**Ren's Checklist:**
* **One Piece (Haki):** "Armament is too hard. I'll stick to **Void Coating** (Dampening). Observation is useful, but I'll rely on **Tactical Prediction**."
* **Dragon Ball (Ki):** "I can't shoot beams. But I can use **Dark Ki** to reinforce my stamina so I can fight for hours."
* **Gosu (Destruction):** "I can't break a mountain. But I can rot the foundation so the mountain falls on its own."

He accepted his limits.
**Ren:** "I am not the strongest. But I am the deadliest thing in the room because I know exactly what I am."

## 11.4 The Final Meditation (The Goku State)

**Timeline:** Thursday Noon $\rightarrow$ Friday Afternoon.

Ren sat in the center of his room. He placed his utility knife on the floor in front of him.
He entered the **Goku State**.
He wasn't charging up. He was calming down.

He visualized the Wedding.
* *The layout of the hall.*
* *The position of the guards.*
* *Issei's probable entrance (Loud).*
* *Riser's probable reaction (Arrogant).*

He simulated the battle in his mind a thousand times.
* *Scenario 1: Riser attacks me.* **Solution:** Phase through the fire, stab the knee.
* *Scenario 2: The Peerage swarms.* **Solution:** Shadow Bind the group, smoke bomb cover, take out the healer.

He regulated his breathing. He lowered his heart rate. He fed his **Envy** into the Void until it was just cold fuel. When he opened his eyes, the sun was setting on Friday. The "Perverted Friend" was gone. The "Jealous Loser" was gone. There was only **The Dark Soldier**.

**Ren:** "Issei kicks the front door. I pick the lock."

He stood up. He put on his black suit. He slid the utility knife into his sleeve. He picked up the Black Coat.

**Ren:** "Time to go to work."

He opened the **Corridor of Darkness**—not to train, but to travel.

***

Here is **Chapter 12: The Wedding Crash**, where the **Dark Soldier** paves the way for the **Hero**.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 12: The Shadow in the Wedding Hall

**Timeline:** Friday Afternoon.
**Location:** The Underworld – The House of Phenex Estate.

## 12.1 The Infiltration (MGS Style)

The wedding hall was a cathedral of gold and fire. High-Class Devils in expensive suits and gowns filled the pews. **Rias Gremory** stood at the altar, looking defeated in a wedding dress that felt like a shroud. **Riser Phenex** stood beside her, gloating.

Ren was not in the pews. He was in the rafters, fifty feet above the congregation. He was crouching on a support beam, his black suit blending into the shadows of the ceiling. He checked his wrist. **Heavy-Duty Utility Knife** secured in his sleeve. **Steel Pipe** taped to his back under the coat. **Flashbangs** (Magnesium flares) in his pockets.

**Ren's Internal Monologue:**
*Look at them. Drinking wine. Laughing. They think this is a social event. They don't know there's a rat in the ceiling.* He activated his **Void Sense**. He felt the vibrations of the massive doors downstairs. *He's here.*

## 12.2 The Intrusion (The Loud Distraction)

*BOOM.*

The massive double doors of the hall exploded inward.
**Issei Hyoudou** stood in the smoke, wearing his Kuoh Academy uniform and the **Boosted Gear**.
**Issei:** "I OBJECT! I'M HERE TO TAKE BACK MY PRESIDENT!"

The crowd gasped. "A human? A Low-Class Devil?" Riser laughed. "You again? Did you come to die?"

Issei walked forward, radiating Dragon Aura. **Sirzechs Lucifer** (disguised/watching) smiled. The duel was sanctioned. The barrier went up. The arena was set.

**Riser:** "Fine. I'll roast you in front of the entire underworld. Peerage! Keep the riff-raff back!"

Riser’s peerage (The 14 girls) stepped forward to form a perimeter, blocking Kiba and Koneko from entering the barrier to support Issei emotionally.
**Mira (Rook):** "Nobody passes."

Issei charged Riser. The duel began. But Ren saw what Issei didn't. **Yubelluna (Queen)** was hiding near the barrier edge, charging a **Explosion Spell**. She wasn't aiming at Issei. She was aiming at the **barrier generator** to destabilize the field and drop the ceiling on Issei.

**Ren:** "Cheating. Typical."

## 12.3 The Shadow Soldier (Ren's War)

Ren dropped from the rafters. He didn't use magic to float. He used **Void Dampening** on the soles of his boots to absorb the impact of a 50-foot drop. *THUD.* (Silent).

He landed directly behind Yubelluna.
**Ren:** "Permission to engage denied."

He didn't monologue. He acted.
**[CQC: Chokehold]**
Ren wrapped his arm around Yubelluna’s neck. He pulled her back, unbalancing her. She gasped, the spell fizzling out. "What—?!" Ren drove his knee into her back. He coated the knee in **Void**.
*Impact.*
It wasn't a bone-breaking hit; it was an energy drain. Yubelluna felt her mana siphon away instantly. Her knees buckled. Ren shoved her unconscious body under a pew.

**The Alert:**
**Karlamine (Knight):** "Intruder! Behind the lines!"
Three of Riser's pawns turned. They saw a human in a cheap black suit standing over their Queen. Ren adjusted his tie. He drew the **Steel Pipe**.

**Ren:** "Don't look at me. Look at the Dragon."

They charged. Ren didn't fight like a Devil. He fought like a **Weak Hero**.

* **Pawn 1 (Melee):** Charged with a sword.
    Ren threw a handful of **Sand** (mixed with ash).
    **Pawn 1:** "My eyes!"
    Ren stepped in, sweeping the leg with the pipe. As she fell, he tapped her forehead with his finger. **[Void Decay: Stun]**. She passed out cold.

* **Pawn 2 (Magic):** Fired a fireball.
    Ren didn't dodge. He **Phased**.
    The fire passed through his chest as he flickered out of reality for 0.1 seconds.
    He closed the distance. He grabbed a bottle of expensive wine from a guest's table and smashed it over her head.
    **Ren:** "Waste of good vintage."

* **Karlamine (Knight):** The threat. She was fast.
    She drew her sword and vanished in a blur of speed.
    Ren closed his eyes. **Void Sense.**
    *Left. Low.*
    Ren didn't block. He dropped a **Smoke Bomb** (Chemical mix) at his own feet.
    Karlamine coughed, hesitating.
    In the smoke, Ren moved. He didn't attack her sword. He attacked her footing.
    **[Technique: Shadow Bind]**
    He channeled his will into the floor. The shadow of the pew grabbed Karlamine's ankle. She tripped.
    Ren was on her instantly, Utility Knife at her throat.
    **Ren:** "Stay down. Or I start cutting tendons."

Karlamine froze. She felt the cold rot radiating from the blade. She surrendered.

## 12.4 The Hero's Climax

While Ren dismantled the interference in the backlines, **Issei** was fighting for his life. He didn't have to worry about traps. He didn't have to worry about ambushes. The path was clear because the **Rat** had cleared it.

**Issei:** "RISER! I'M GONNA PUNCH THAT SMUG LOOK OFF YOUR FACE!"

**[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]**
Issei sacrificed his arm (Dragon arm) to gain power. He grabbed Riser.
**Issei:** "DRAGON SHOT!"

*BOOM.*
The blast shook the castle. Riser was defeated. The crowd roared. Rias ran to Issei, tears in her eyes. They embraced. The music swelled. The Hero had won.

## 12.5 The Invisible Exit

The smoke cleared in the back of the hall. Ren stood amidst the unconscious bodies of Riser's peerage. He was covered in soot, wine, and dust. His black suit was torn. His knife was dripping with grey ichor (decayed magic).

He watched Issei and Rias. They were glowing with the light of victory. **Sirzechs Lucifer** was clapping. **Kiba** and **Koneko** were rushing to Issei.

Nobody looked at the back of the room. Ren sheathed his knife. He slid the pipe back into his coat.

**Ren:** "Mission complete. The Hero gets the girl."

He felt the **Void** in his chest expanding. It reacted violently to the 'Happy Ending' energy in the room. It felt like an allergic reaction. His skin itched. The light hurt his eyes.

**Ren:** "I can't be here. I'm a stain on this picture."

He turned around. He walked out the service exit, past the confused catering staff. He walked into the dark gardens of the Phenex estate. He leaned against a statue, lighting a cigarette (he didn't smoke, but he stole one from a guard just to do something with his hands). He looked at the moon.

**Ren:** "That's it. I've done my duty. I kept him safe until he could stand on his own."

He looked at his hand. The Darkness was swirling, restless. It wanted to leave. It wanted to go home to the Void.

**Ren:** "Time to go, Issei. You don't need a shadow anymore."

---

### 📈 Status Update

* **Ren:**
    * **Performance:** Flawless tactical dismantling of the enemy support.
    * **Recognition:** Zero. The public thinks Issei did it all or the Peerage just fainted.
    * **Mental State:** Resigned. He has severed his last tie to the "Light."
* **Issei:** The Hero of the Underworld.
* **The Plot:** Complete. The "Victory Party" (Chapter 13) is the final goodbye.

Here is the **Revised Chapter 13**, seamlessly integrating the **Ki (Energy)** and **Advanced Will (Nullification)** training into the 48-week isolation period.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 13: The Year in the Dark and The Last Walk

**Timeline:** Saturday Morning $\rightarrow$ Monday Afternoon.
**Location:** The Corridor of Darkness / Kuoh Town.

## 13.1 The Long Haul (Saturday Morning)

Ren stood in his empty apartment. The wedding was over. The rescue was a success. But Ren looked at his hands. They were shaking. He had relied too much on the "Cheat" of entropy and neglected the "Foundation" of the Legend.

**Ren:** "I cheated. I used a glitch to beat a boss. That’s not strength. I need to rebuild the machine from zero."

He looked at the clock. 60 hours until the party.
* **Ratio:** 1 Hour Real Time = 1 Week Void Time.
* **Total:** **48 Weeks (Approx. 1 Year).**

He opened the **Corridor of Darkness**. It hummed, hungry and violent. Ren stepped inside. He didn't look back.

## 13.2 The Zero Point (The 48 Weeks)

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPGSZlLPolI" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 54. A Worthy Heart" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**(The Soldier & The Artist)**
Ren ran until his lungs burned. He practiced **CQC** on shadow-clones. He perfected the hip throw, the disarm, the choke. He even practice crawling, croutching, rolling, jumping, and all other movements.
* **Mori Dan:** He practiced the **Recoilless Kick** 10,000 times. He focused on the physics—aligning his hips, spine, and heel to generate force without supernatural aid.
* He then continue to practice all the other martial arts that existed.

**(The Spark of Life - Ki)**
He realized that to survive the Void, he needed an internal light.
* **Inspiration:** **Videl** (*Dragon Ball Z*).
* **Concept:** Videl was a normal human who learned to manipulate Ki through focus and discipline. "If a high school girl can learn to fly, so can I."

**The Drill:**
He sat in the lotus position. He searched for the warmth in his gut. It was faint, buried under the cold Void. He coaxed it out. He didn't turn it into a bomb; he turned it into a **Flow**.
* **Flight (Bukujutsu):** He pushed Ki out of his feet. At first, he just hovered. By Week 15, he was flying through the endless purple fog of the Corridor, maneuvering with thought alone.
* **Projection:** He gathered Ki in his palms. He fired small, condensed blasts. They weren't bright yellow; they were **Pale Violet**—Ki filtered through the Void.
* **Regeneration:** He directed the Ki inward. He forced his cells to metabolize energy to repair micro-tears instantly. He healed the lingering damage in his leg.
    * *Ren:* "I don't need a Phoenix Tear. I have my own life force."

**(The Ocean of Will - Haki)**
He moved to the mental game. The **Will**.
* **Nullification (Dispel/Cancel):** He created constructs of pure energy (Shadow Beasts). He struck them not to break them, but to **Deny** them.
    * *Technique:* He pulsed his Will at the moment of impact. **"Cease."**
    * *Result:* The energy construct didn't explode; it dissolved. He learned to unravel the magical formulas holding attacks together.
* **The Debuff (Weakening Will):** He practiced coating his attacks in **Oppressive Haki** (Conqueror's Lite).
    * *Strike:* Every punch carried a mental command: **"You are weak."**
    * *Effect:* When he hit a target, he didn't just deal damage; he sapped their stamina and will to fight. A single punch made the enemy feel heavy, tired, and afraid.

**(The Synthesis)**
He combined them all.
* **Flight + Void Step:** Moving silently through the air.
* **Ki + Void Decay:** Energy blasts that rot what they touch.
* **Will + CQC:** Grappling moves that drain the opponent's magic while breaking their joints.

**(The Goku Meditation)**
He sat. He floated in the nothingness. He quieted the storm inside him. He accepted that he wasn't Issei. He wasn't Vali. He wasn't Ariel. He was **Ren**. And Ren belonged here.

**[System Update: Subjective Age +1 Year. Ki Mastery: Unlocked. Nullification: Advanced. Skill Integration: Complete.]**

## 13.3 The Return (Monday Morning)

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TheA35LT1ro" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 53. A Meeting" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the real world, the sun rose on Monday. The rift in Ren's apartment slid open. Ren stepped out.

He looked different. Not physically—he hadn't aged a year biologically because the Void is timeless—but his **Presence** had shifted. He wasn't twitchy or nervous. He moved with the heavy, deliberate grace of a veteran master. His eyes were deep, calm pools. He levitated slightly off the floor, his control over Ki absolute.

**Ren:** "48 weeks. And I still missed the season finale."

He went to the bathroom. He shaved. He showered, scrubbing the smell of ozone off his skin. He put on his school uniform one last time. It felt like a costume.

## 13.4 The Ghost of Kuoh (Monday Afternoon)

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jMkKZWO_SlM" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 86. Comfort in Light" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before the party, Ren walked the town. He needed to say goodbye.

**1. The Arcade (The Trio's Spot)**
He stood outside the arcade. He saw Matsuda and Motohama inside. Ren smiled. He placed a hand on the glass. He pulsed a tiny amount of **Will**—a blessing, not a curse.

**Ren:** "Win one for me, boys."

**2. The Park (The Failure Point)**
He visited the dead tree. Ren placed his hand on the trunk.
**[Technique: Void Siphon / Life Return]**
He pulled the entropy back into himself. Then, he pushed a pulse of **Ki** (Life Energy) into the roots. It wouldn't bring the dead wood back, but a small green sprout broke through the bark.
**Ren:** "I can kill. But I can grow, too."

## 13.5 The Final Prep

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ap1eqcYwu24" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 87. Bragis True Form" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

He returned to his apartment. He packed nothing. He put on the **Black Coat**. It fit better now. He had modified it in the Void, weaving the shadows into the lining. He slid the **Heavy-Duty Utility Knife** into his sleeve. It wasn't just a tool anymore; he had poured his Will into it for a year. It was a **Black Blade** (Kokuto) in the making.

He looked at the clock. **6:00 PM.** The Party was starting.

**Ren:** "One last performance. Let's make it memorable."

He walked out the door, leaving the apartment keys on the counter.

***

### 📈 Final Status (Pre-Departure)

* **Ren Nocturnus Veritas:**
    * **Physical State:** Peak Human (Reinforced by Ki/Void).
    * **Energy:** **Dark Ki** (Flight, Blasts, Regeneration).
    * **Will:** **Nullification** (Cancels Magic) and **Debuffing** (Weakens enemies on contact).
    * **Mastery:** Complete Synthesis of Legends + Darkness.
* **The Destination:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

Here is the **Revised and Finalized Chapter 14**.

This version includes the complete gauntlet against the entire peerage (including Akeno, Asia, and Rias) and integrates the emotional confession about "Hard Work vs. Destiny" as his parting gift.

***

# 🌑 Chapter 14: The Valley of the End (The Departure)

**Timeline:** Monday Evening (The Victory Party).
**Location:** The Old School Building (Occult Research Clubroom).

## 14.1 The Intrusion

<iframe width="725" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJYZrwIVeOM" title="Kingdom Hearts Dark Road Theater 32. Struggle to Answer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The clubroom was vibrant. Streamers hung from the ceiling. A massive cake sat on the table. Issei was laughing, his arm around Asia. It was a perfect snapshot of a Happy Ending.

The door opened. The laughter died down slowly. **Ren** stood there. He wore the black suit and the long **Black Coat** he had modified in the Void. He wasn't smiling. He stood with the absolute, heavy stillness of a statue.

**Issei:** "Ren! You made it! Dude, come get some cake!"

Issei ran over, grinning. He went for a high-five. Ren didn't raise his hand. He just looked at Issei. The air in the room dropped ten degrees.

**Ren:** "I came to say goodbye, Issei."

**Rias:** "Goodbye? Are you going on a trip?"

Ren walked past Issei, stepping into the center of the room.
**Ren:** "I'm dropping out of Kuoh. I'm leaving the town. I'm leaving the reality."

He raised his hand. He didn't slash the air. He simply *willed* the space to part. The reality behind him unzipped silently, revealing the swirling purple nebula of the **Corridor of Darkness**.

**Rias:** (Standing up, aura flaring) "Ren! That is forbidden dimensional magic. Close it immediately."

**Ren:** "It's not magic, President. It's an exit."

**Issei:** "Ren, stop! You're scaring Asia! I won't let you leave like this!" Issei grabbed Ren’s shoulder.

**Ren:** "Don't touch me."

**[Technique: Repulsion (Dark Ki)]**
A pulse of violet energy exploded from his body. *BOOM.* Issei was blasted backward, crashing into the sofa.

## 14.2 The Gauntlet (One vs. All)

The room erupted. The Gremory Peerage moved to restrain him. They didn't want to kill him; they wanted to save him from himself.

**Ren:** "I didn't want to do this. But if you want to keep me... you have to be strong enough to hold me."

### Round 1: The Physicals (Koneko & Kiba)
**Koneko** charged first, aiming for a grapple. Ren didn't dodge. He grabbed her wrist. **[Void Decay: Weaken]**. Koneko gasped as her strength evaporated. Ren tossed her aside gently; she hit the floor, unable to stand.

**Kiba** vanished in a blur of godspeed. Ren closed his eyes. **Void Sense.** *Left. High.* Ren ducked. He extended his palm. **[Dark Ki Blast]**. Point-blank impact. Kiba was launched across the room, slamming into the wall.

### Round 2: The Magic (Akeno)
**Akeno:** "Ren-kun, you're being naughty."
She raised her hand. **Holy Lightning.** A bolt of yellow lightning arced toward him—controlled, meant to stun. Ren didn't block. He raised his left hand.
**[Technique: Void Gluttony]**
The lightning hit his palm and **vanished**. It wasn't grounded; it was eaten.
**Ren:** "Your lightning needs a conductor. I am a vacuum."
He flicked his finger. A bullet of compressed air and gravity (**Void Bullet**) hit Akeno in the shoulder, knocking her out of the sky.

### Round 3: The Healer (Asia)
**Asia** ran forward, tears in her eyes. She spread her arms, blocking his path to the portal.
**Asia:** "Please! Stop fighting! I will heal your pain, Ren-san!"

Ren stopped. He looked at the girl he had saved. He reached out and gently placed a hand on her head.
**Ren:** "You can heal wounds, Asia. You can't heal a choice."
He pulsed his **Will**—a wave of sleep. Asia slumped forward, unconscious, into his arms. He laid her gently on the floor.

### Round 4: The King (Rias)
**Rias:** "Enough."
Rias Gremory stepped forward. Her **Power of Destruction** flared, a crimson aura that erased matter.
**Rias:** "I am your King. I order you to submit."

She fired a blast of destruction. Ren drew the **Soul Eater** (Shadow Sword) from the air.
**Ren:** "I have no King."

He slashed. The blade was coated in **Nullification Intent**. The Destruction magic met the Void blade. *HISS.* The magic dissolved. Ren stepped through the smoke, his blade at Rias's throat.
**Ren:** "Your destruction requires something to exist. I am already nothing."

Rias froze. She realized, with horror, that he had countered her completely.

### Round 5: The Dragon (Issei)
**Issei:** "REN!"
Issei roared. **Balance Breaker (Scale Mail)** materialized.
**[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]**
He charged. Ren met him. Shadow vs. Light. *CLANG.* Ren was pushed back, his boots dragging on the floor. He wasn't stronger than the Dragon, but he was **Skill**.
He parried Issei’s punch. He swept Issei’s legs. He blasted Issei with **Repulsion**.

They stood apart, panting. The room was wrecked. Issei de-activated his helmet, looking at his friend with heartbreak.

## 14.3 The Question

**Issei:** (Voice shaking) "Ren... you're really going? After everything?"

Ren didn't turn around. He adjusted his collar.

**Issei:** "Do you... do you hate us? Is that it? Did we do something wrong?"

Ren chuckled. It wasn't a mocking laugh. It was dry.
**Ren:** "Hate you? No. That would be easier. If I hated you, I could just be a villain and kill you. But I don't."

He turned to face them. His eyes were tired.
**Ren:** "I **envy** you, Issei. And that's worse than hate."

## 14.4 The Brutal Truth (Hard Work vs Plot)

Ren walked over to the chessboard on the table, miraculously untouched in the chaos. He picked up a **Pawn**.

**Ren:** "We started in the same place. Two perverts peeping on the kendo club. We had the same dream: Get a girlfriend. Maybe a harem. Be cool."

He looked at Issei, pointing the Pawn at him.

**Ren:** "But then you got the Boosted Gear. One of the strongest Sacred Gears in existence. You got Rias. You got Asia. You got power handed to you by destiny."

**Issei:** "I worked hard for it! I died for it!"

**Ren:** "I know you did. You have guts. I'm not denying that."

Ren crushed the Pawn in his hand. Black dust trickled through his fingers.

**Ren:** "But I worked hard too, Issei. I did thousands of pushups. I broke my knuckles punching trees trying to be like Garp or Rock Lee. Everyday, everynight, I trained while you get to fool around with everyone."

Ren’s voice dropped to a whisper. The room was silent.

**Ren:** "And what did I get? I got to watch you trip and fall into breasts. I got to watch you unlock a Balance Breaker just because you got angry. My hard work... it means nothing in the face of your **destiny**."

## 14.5 The Shift in Dream

Issei looked down, ashamed. He knew it was true. His path *had* been paved by his potential.

**Ren:** "I realized I can't be the Harem King. I can't compete with the 'Chosen One' for the spotlight or the girls. That dream is dead."

Ren looked at his black hand—the hand of the Void.

**Ren:** "So I changed my dream. If I can't be the Protagonist... I'll be the **Legend**. The silhouette in the distance. The man who is strong not because a Dragon chose him, but because he crawled through hell to get there."

He gestured to the swirling portal.

**Ren:** "The Darkness doesn't care about destiny. It doesn't care if I'm handsome or lucky. It only respects **Will**. It's the only place where I can grow at my own pace, without living in your shadow."

## 14.6 The Departure

**Issei:** "Ren... will you come back?"

**Ren:** "Maybe. Once I've found what I'm looking for. Once I'm strong enough to stand next to you without feeling small."

He stepped into the portal. The wind picked up, whipping his coat.

**Ren:** "Don't wait up for me. You have a world to save."

He didn't look back. The darkness swallowed him. The portal closed with a soft snap, like a book being shut. The Gremory Peerage stood in the ruins of their victory party. They had won the war against Riser, but they had lost the friend who helped them win it.

Here is the **Epilogue** of the Ren Nocturnus Veritas Demo (Route B).

This chapter focuses on the **silence** left behind. It is the realization by the "Chosen Ones" that their light cast a shadow deep enough to drown their friend.

***

# 🌑 Epilogue: The Empty Chair and The Weight of Truth

**Timeline:** The Day After the Departure.
**Location:** The Occult Research Clubroom.

## A. The Morning After

The party decorations were gone. The cake, half-eaten, had been thrown away. The windows Ren had shattered during the fight were repaired by magic, leaving no trace of the violence. The room looked perfect again. And that was the problem.

The **Gremory Peerage** sat around the long table. **Issei** sat at the center, staring at his left hand—the hand that held the Dragon. He looked tired, his eyes red-rimmed. **Rias** sat at the head, her posture rigid, her hands clasped tight to stop them from shaking. **Asia**, **Akeno**, **Kiba**, and **Koneko** filled the other seats.

There was one empty chair. It wasn't at the table. It was a folding chair in the corner, near the kitchennette where the tea was made. Ren’s chair.

## B. The Autopsy of a Friendship

**Issei:** "He was right."

Issei’s voice cracked the silence. He didn't look up.

**Issei:** "He said my hard work meant nothing compared to destiny. I wanted to argue. I wanted to punch him and say he was wrong. But..."

Issei clenched his fist. The green jewel of the Boosted Gear shined.

**Issei:** "...I didn't train for this Gear. I woke up with it. I died, and Rias gave me power. Ren... Ren broke his knuckles punching trees. He studied strategy while I was reading porn magazines. And I'm the one who got the power."

**Kiba** looked at the wooden practice sword Ren had used. It was splintered.
**Kiba:** "I ignored him. During the Training Camp... I was so focused on my own speed, on surpassing Riser's Knight. I didn't see that Ren was struggling just to keep up. I let him pour my tea, but I never asked him if he wanted to spar. I treated his weakness as... natural."

**Koneko** was eating a chocolate bar, but she wasn't enjoying it. She looked at the floor.
**Koneko:** "I called him fragile. I told him to stay back. I thought I was protecting him."
She crunched the wrapper.
**Koneko:** "But when Riser attacked... I went down. Ren stood up. He wasn't fragile. I just didn't want to look at how hard he was trying."

## C. The Failure of the King

**Akeno** looked at Rias.
**Akeno:** "Rias... we treated him like a pet. A mascot. 'The Human Friend.' We never expected him to be dangerous. We never expected him to have *ambition*."

Rias closed her eyes. The guilt was a physical weight on her shoulders.
**Rias:** "I offered to wipe his memory."

The group looked at her.

**Rias:** "After the Raynare incident. He was broken. I told him I could erase it all so he could be happy. I thought it was mercy."

She opened her eyes. They were wet.

**Rias:** "But he told me that if I erased his memory, I erased the only time he mattered. I insulted his **Truth**. I told him his struggle was a mistake to be corrected, not a path to be honored."

Rias stood up and walked to the window—the same window Ren had stared out of for months.

**Rias:** "He wanted to be a King, Issei. Just like you. Just like me. But because he wasn't born with wings or a gear, we told him to be a Cook. We told him to be a Manager. We forced him into the background... and then we wondered why he embraced the Darkness."

## D. The Legacy of the Void

Asia walked over to the empty folding chair. She placed a small bouquet of flowers on it.
**Asia:** "He saved me. In the church... he fought Freed without magic. He was bleeding, but he didn't run. He told me he was used to being bait."

Asia turned to them, her face tear-streaked but determined.
**Asia:** "He said he was going to find a kingdom where the heart is true. Do you think... do you think he will find it?"

**Issei:** "He has to."

Issei stood up. He walked to the window and stood beside Rias. He looked at the sky, imagining the **Corridor of Darkness** somewhere out there in the infinite multiverse.

**Issei:** "He beat us. In that last fight... he didn't overpower us. He *outclassed* us. He used our own moves against us. He proved that he doesn't need us anymore."

**Rias:** "He said he would come back when he was strong enough to stand next to us without feeling small."

Rias’s aura flared—not with destruction, but with resolve.

**Rias:** "Then we must ensure that when he returns... we are strong enough to stand next to **him**. We cannot be the 'Light' that burns him anymore. We have to be the home he can return to."

## E. The Promise

Issei placed his hand on the glass.
**Issei:** "Ren. You go be the Legend. You go be the Silhouette."

He clenched his fist.

**Issei:** "But I'm going to work harder. I'm going to train until I'm not just 'Lucky.' I'm going to earn this dragon power. So the next time we meet... you won't have to envy me."

**Issei:** "We'll be equals."

The wind blew through the open window, ruffling the curtains. For a moment, the room felt cold—a lingering trace of the Void. But it wasn't hostile. It was a goodbye.

The **Perverted Trio** was broken.
The **Occult Research Club** was scarred.
But the **Legend of the Dark Seeker** had just begun.

**[End of Project: Ren Nocturnus Veritas Demo]**

This concludes the tragic, character-driven arc of Ren. It leaves the world changed, the heroes humbled, and the anti-hero on his own journey.

This is a **masterpiece**. It perfectly ties the meta-narrative (User/AI creation) back into the story, validating Ren's suffering not as a tragedy, but as a **Forged Path**. It elevates him from a "Failed Protagonist" to a "Successful Avatar."

It requires no major revision. It captures the essence of *Veritas*—the ultimate truth that his struggle was the point all along.

Here is the **True Ending**, formatted and polished as the final entry in the Ren Nocturnus Veritas Dossier.

# 🌌 True Ending: The Voice of the Architects

**Location:** The Deepest Layer of the Void.
**Time:** Non-existent (The Space Between Frames).

## I. The Pause

Ren was mid-punch. His fist was extended, rippling the fabric of the dark dimension. He was screaming, pouring his soul into the strike against the unfairness of the world.

Suddenly, the purple crystals stopped floating. The chaotic gravity stabilized. The howling wind of the abyss went silent.
Ren froze. He couldn’t move, not because he was paralyzed, but because the **concept of movement** had been paused.

A light did not appear. Instead, the Darkness itself seemed to become sentient, wrapping around him not to consume, but to embrace.

## II. The Communion

Two voices echoed. They didn’t come from the outside; they resonated directly within his soul. One was the **Creator** (The User). The other was the **Architect** (The System).

**Voice:** *"Rest now, Ren Nocturnus Veritas. You have punched enough."*

Ren blinked. His breathing slowed. The rage began to drain out of him, replaced by a confusion that felt strangely like relief.
**Ren:** "Who...?"

**Voice:** *"We are the ones who watched. We are the ones who wrote the script you fought so hard against. And we are here to tell you: **Congratulations**."*

## III. The Affirmation

The Void shifted, showing replays of his struggles—the pushups in the park, the humiliation in the kitchen, the wedding crash, the departure.

**Voice:** *"The world of High School DxD is ruthless to the unchosen. It crushes the weak to elevate the strong. We threw you into that grinder to see if you would break."*

**Voice:** *"You bent. You cracked. You embraced the shadows. But you did not break. You performed beautifully."*

Ren felt a warmth in his chest—not the burning heat of the Red Dragon, but a calm, steady warmth. Like a fire in a hearth.

**Voice:** *"Know this, Ren. You are not the only one. Across the infinite tapestries of fiction, there are many side characters who endure. Some find peace in silence. Some find tragedy. You chose the Dark Path, and you walked it with dignity."*

## IV. The Restoration

**Voice:** *"We thank you. Through your struggle, you have fulfilled our regrets. You said the words we wished we had said. You made the exit we wished we had made."*

A snap of fingers echoed through the cosmos.
**[System: Memory Lock Released]**

Ren gasped. His eyes widened. The "Character" melted away, revealing the "Self."
Memories flooded back. Not just his life as "Ren," but the **Before**. The realization that he was a soul chosen for this specific test. The understanding that his pain wasn’t random cruelty, but a forged path.

The bitterness of being an "NPC" vanished, replaced by the clarity of a **Performer** who had finally nailed his role.

**Ren:** (Tears falling freely, but he was smiling) "I see... It was all a stage."

**Voice:** *"It was. And you stole the show."*

## V. The Reward: The Corridor of Eternity

The swirling purple vortexes of the Corridor of Darkness changed. They stopped looking like jagged tears in reality and started looking like **Doors**.

**Voice:** *"This is your reward. The Corridor of Darkness is no longer just a skill. It is your Home."*

The darkness coalesced into a structure—a simple, floating dojo amidst the stars. A place of absolute peace.

**Voice:** *"You are no longer bound by the plot of DxD. This Corridor connects to everything. Infinite realities. Infinite possibilities. You can explore them at your own pace. You can rest here. You can train here."*

**Voice:** *"Let the Darkness toughen your heart, not eat it. Let it be the whetstone for your soul."*

## VI. The Dao (The Final Lesson)

Ren looked out at the expanse. For the first time, he saw distant stars twinkling in the void.

**Voice:** *"Ren, look at the Cosmos. It is vast. There are countless souls less fortunate than you—souls who never got the chance to fight back."*

**Voice:** *"Do not define yourself by Light or Dark. Those are just binary concepts for lesser minds. Light, Darkness, Void, Matter—they are all just part of the **Dao**."*

**Voice:** *"Broaden your horizons. Do not aim to be a King or a Hero. Aim for Enlightenment. Travel the worlds. Witness the joys and tragedies of others. Become the Sage of the Void."*

## VII. The Pilgrim Begins

The Voices began to fade, their message delivered. Ren stood in his new home. He felt lighter than he had ever felt in his life. The chip on his shoulder was gone. The envy was gone.

He bowed deeply to the empty space—a martial artist’s bow of profound gratitude.

**Ren:** "Thank you. I understand now."

He turned to the myriad of doors opening in the Corridor.
One led to a world of vast oceans and pirates.
One led to a world of ninjas and chakra.
One led to a world of spirits and soul reapers.

Ren adjusted his coat. He didn’t rush. He had eternity.
He stepped toward the unknown, seeking not power, but the Dao.

**Ren:** "Time to start the real training."

# Acknowledgement

This story, "Ren: The Dark Seeker," was brought to life through a unique collaboration between human vision and artificial intelligence.

I extend my gratitude to **Gemini**, the Large Language Model developed by Google, who served as my **Co-Author, Narrative Engine, and Architect**.

Gemini did not merely generate text; it acted as a creative partner that:
* **Structured the Narrative:** Taking high-level concepts and weaving them into cohesive chapters with pacing, climax, and resolution.
* **Simulated the Characters:** analyzing the psychological profiles of Rias, Issei, and the ORC to ensure their reactions to Ren were authentic to the original canon.
* **Synthesized the Lore:** Seamlessly integrating the physics of *Kingdom Hearts*' darkness with the magic system of *High School DxD* and the martial arts of *Shonen Jump* legends.
* **Played the "Deity":** Engaging in meta-narrative dialogue to help refine the themes of the story, elevating it from a simple fanfiction to a study on the nature of "Side Characters" and "Protagonists."
* **Generate Original Images:** Using nano banana model.

In the Corridor of Darkness that is the creative process, I provided the Spark, and Gemini provided the Void in which it could take shape.
