## Imagination and Image Training - Reality

Vivid imagination or visualizations will help in supernatural training modules. While moving energies like chi, qi, or ki can be done with relaxation and awareness but visualization can be additional boost. Other than that, there are times where we cannot train in the open so image training is the only option. 

## Fear Training - Reality

Fear is the biggest obstacle in fighting. In order to overcome fear, we must train ourselves to be used to it. The best way is to put ourselves in fearful situations. Watching horror movies, going to haunted houses, walking alone at night, etc.

It is mainly about being aware of our body and our other conditions and able to relax when needed to heal or to focus. This is the reality module version of Inner and Outer Energy (chi, qi, ki), the soldier version where you have to able to sleep anywhere at anytime, and the placebo effect by feeling the pains and wishing it to heal. There are many ways to train this such as yoga, Yoga Nidra, tai chi, Zhan Zhuang, qigong, breathing exercises, grounding, etc.

## Meditation and Empty Mind - Reality

Clearing mind and heart to rest them and to prepare for further modules.

## Lucid Dream - Reality

In other words, we force ourselves to sleep when not tired and willing to have lucid dreams which is few steps before out of body experience or astral projection.

# Obselete or Ongoing

This is a core fighting training manual for my fictions. I would like to write another world and reincarnation novels. Therefore, this is a note of some trainings for the story's development.

## Remembering The Basics

Let's say the story will take training from the very begining as a normal human. Ofcourse the very first thing is being able to fight and manuvering. These are basics in the wild where anyone can reflexly do due to the demand of survival. Most of these population are unaware of their own techniques which is why these techniques are lost when the world became a safer place. While as nations we became stronger, but as individuals physically we have became weaker. There is also survival but let's add that later when I have more knowledge.

### Manuvering

Manuvering is the most basic skill any creature in the wild have. Being able to run, jump, climb, and passing by objects as swiftly as possible is a skill necessary in the wild. Since we live in society where environments are safe, we no longer need manuvering skills which is why we forget. Manuvering can be trained by going through obstacle courses or parkour.

### Self Defense

There are many different styles of martial arts but all of the self defense techniques have the same objective which is being able to handle attacks. Either by guarding, parrying, avoiding, or even attacking. This is also a very basic skill in the wild but because we live in society, we no longer needed to fight and we became stupid to not even being able to defend ourselves. 

In the wild, guarding is a reflex where nobody is needed to be taught how to guard. Guarding is just about tightening our muscles. Even in physics, the harder the object, the harder to break. By tightening our muscles, we make our body hard. Why do people mostly uses their arms to cover their body? It is because our arm is the easiest muscle to control and to tighten thus the esiest way to use to guard.

Parrying is different from guarding. It is redirecting an attack. This is theory that most sport martial artist learns. While parrying is superior to guarding, many sport martial artists forgets that parrying requires precision. If you get the timing wrong you will get hit and the battlefield is not easily predictable like in the lectures or else everybody can win. With sport martial artists greatly theorize on parrying, makes them forget how to guard which is the basic reflex.

Avoiding or dodging in theory is simple which is just do not get hit. The question is, how to move our body well enough to not get hit? In the wild, the technique is honed through experience but what about those in society who almost never needs to dodge? The answer is learn stepping comfortable, learn bending our body comfortable, and learn aerobics.

How can we take down an opponent without attacking or how to know how to defend without knowing how the attacks will be? It is very strange in this society world nowadays where girls only know how to slap and boys only know how to push and stranggle. On the contrary, bookworms sport martial artists only knows how to punch and kick and forgeting about pushing, stranggling, and even slapping, and do not know that there are also charging, tackling, grapling, and even picking up objects.

## Honing Strong Points

This is where the fiction starts. In reality, honing techniques is the only thing we can do currently and only through great length of time we can become known character that can survive many battles unlike those nobodies soldiers. However in fictions, there are abilities for surviving fatalities that can be learned faster.

### Inner Energy

With inner energy activated, anything becomes possible. The most famous early introduction for this idea is Dragon Ball originates from the idea of the shaolin monks. Eventually, most martial arts fictions adopts this concept.

### Iron Body



### Sharp Perception

### Fast Regeneration
