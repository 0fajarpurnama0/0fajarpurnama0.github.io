Up to today, there is only a unidirectional connection between the benefits of the fans and the stars. Fans gives a lot of supports to their stars while stars only receives. The result is sad to see that stars receives wealth, fame, and fortune, while fans receives nothing materialistic. What fans benefits are amusement, excitement, and motivation. New talents may not receive the same opportunity as the talent industry tends to become more monopolize. [Jetcoin aims to fix this where the success of the stars can also become the success of the fans](https://jetcoin.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Litepaper.pdf) and can provide more opportunities for new talents to become stars.



## The Talent Industry

The talent industry is an industry where talented people can become famous. No matter how talented a person is, that person can never be "called" talented if nobody knows. The role of the industry in anyway is to provide activities to promote their talents. Goods and services can be divided into necessities and desires. Necessities are primary that we may die if we do not consume such as foods, drinks, shelters, and medical services, while desires are secondary that we can still survive without them such as snacks, luxuries, media, and entertainment. Secondaries can be divided into goods and services that have direct impact and indirect impact. Examples of secondaries with direct impacts are information communication technologies where we can get and exchange information quickly, transportations to quickly move between places, electronics with various applications, cosmetics for beauty, fashions for style, and therapies for better health. The talent industry is a secondary with indirect impacts that mainly entertains people to bring joy and amusement. There are for example martial arts used in the talent industry but their purpose are different. Martial arts on the battle field are used to survive while martial arts used in the talent industry specifically the entertainment industry are used to obtain fame and fortune such as performing martial arts in movies and exhibitions. Therefore, the income of the talent industry strictly comes from other people which means if there are no people willing to pay for them, then no income will flow and that is why talents without the people's support means nothing.

In the distant past talented people naturally participated in many activities, showed their skills, and become famous but their popularity can only reach few regions. The technologies today allows talented people to become world class stars but the load and scope of their jobs increases as well where most of the time becomes complicated. Honing their talents are not longer their only jobs. They must handle administration, cooperation, imaging, legal actions, management, marketing, publishing, social media, and many other activities which in the end may break their focus. Which is why today many stars have talent agencies to manage all those complicated things and personal managers to handle their daily schedules where in the end they can just focus on honing their talents.



## Problem in the Industry

The problem with some talent agencies is that some of them charges high fees and long contracts. A legend among them is Don King that charges way over 50% that causes the former world heavy weight boxing champion Mike Tyson to file for bankcrupcy. Today, the average fee for talent agency is in average 20% which many stars find comfortable.



## Rumors of Mafia in the Industry

With some talent agency charging high fees and long contracts, talents who decided to break the contract are often denied performance on stage for many years. Even worse, they can be faced with law suit. Which is why some time later in the future, talents often hire a lawyer before signing a contract and usually mafia talent agency immediately dismisses the talent if they decide to come with a lawyer. An even sinister rumor in actresses, some talent agencies forces their actresses to sleep with the movie director in order to secure a role.



## They are not even the main problem

The ones that incur the most losses are actually the fans. Fans are the ones who brings wealth, fame, and fortune to these stars. Without fans, they are nothing, and yet fans receives absolutely nothing. They even incur expenses by buying tickets to watch their performance, buying their merchandise, and allocated a lot of time contributing to these stars. This is the very definition that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.



## Jetcoin aims to solve this problem
