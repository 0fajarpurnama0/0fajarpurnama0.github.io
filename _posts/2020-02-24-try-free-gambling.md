## 0\. Quick Statements

* To gamble in casinos have many restrictions for most people, online gambling sites are usually not cheap, but for crypto sites you can start for free and may continue being free.
* The sites usually give you free coins to try gambling.
* They also usually giveaway free coins daily.
* If you are not allow to gamble, personally is no problem for as long as you don't deposit your money. Just use the money that they gave you. In my opinion, gambling is waging your own money to gain more where you can risk of losing everything. It's fine if you are waging free money right?
* Sure getting quick money almost always just a dream but why not try the games and enjoy instead of thinking about profits.

## 1\. Simple Multipliers

Just as the heading said, wager some coins to be multiplied by 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, etc. Here are some list:
