Ariel Otaku are by Fajar Purnama and Gemini Pro AI

## 📕 Chapter 1: The Peeping Tom Who Wanted to Be a King
Timeline: Spring. The start of the 2nd Year for Issei Hyoudou.
Location: Kuoh Academy.
1. The Manifestation (The Unremarkable Start)
Ariel Caelum Veritas stood in front of the mirror in his small, run-down apartment.
He was 17. He was slightly overweight. He had average looks. And right now, he was fiercely jealous.
He had manifested in this world three days ago with no memories of the plot, only his name, his personality (Veritas - Truthful to a fault), and a burning desire to be "The Protagonist."
He checked his imaginary status screen (The Observer Channel in his mind).
[PHY: 0.8 (Soft) | MND: 1.2 (Distracted) | SPR: 0.1 (Weak)]
"I'm a mob character," Ariel muttered honestly. "I'm the guy in the background of the cafeteria scene who eats bread and says nothing."
He clenched his fist. It felt soft.
"But I know the Silhouettes. I know how the Legends move. I just need to bridge the gap."
2. The Kendo Club Incident (The Perverted Quartet)
Location: Behind the Old Gymnasium.
Characters: Issei, Matsuda, Motohama, and Ariel.
Ariel was crouching in the bushes with the notorious Perverted Trio. In this timeline, it was the Perverted Quartet.
Matsuda: "Target confirmed. The Kendo Club is changing. The skylight is open."
Issei: "Hehehe... oppai... glorious oppai..."
Ariel: (Sweating, heart pounding) "Guys, the angle is bad. If we shift three degrees left, we get a better view of the Vice-Captain. But the structural integrity of this tree branch is questionable."
Ariel was undeniably a pervert. He wanted to see. He was a teenage boy driven by hormones. But he also felt a crushing wave of Inferiority.
Why am I hiding in a bush? he thought. The Legends—Roger, Garp, Mori Jin—they don't hide in bushes. Women flock to them because they are Great. I am here because I am Small.
Suddenly, a white-haired girl (Koneko Toujou) appeared from nowhere.
Koneko: "Scum."
She didn't attack. She just looked at them with absolute, freezing disgust.
Issei, Matsuda, and Motohama panicked and ran.
Ariel froze. He looked Koneko in the eye. His nature as Veritas kicked in.
Ariel: "You're right. This is pathetic. We are scum."
Koneko paused, surprised by the sudden honesty.
Ariel: "I'm running away now. Not because I'm scared, but because I'm embarrassed."
Ariel turned and jogged away, his overweight frame jiggling slightly.
Koneko watched him go. Weird guy, she thought. At least he owns it.
3. The PTD: Converting Lust to Power
Location: Ariel's Apartment (Night).
Ariel lay on his floor, humiliated. The look in Koneko's eyes burned. He felt small. He wanted to be big.
He accessed the Personal Training Dossier (PTD).
> Observer: "Welcome, Ariel. Stress levels detected. Inferiority Complex active. Recommended course?"
> 
"I want to be strong," Ariel said. "I want to stop chasing and start attracting. Load The Heavenly Destroyer simulation. Level 1."
The Training (The Grind):
He didn't fight a master. He fought gravity.
He did pushups until his arms shook.
Every time he wanted to quit, he imagined Issei—who was just as much of a loser—getting lucky.
"Issei has main character energy. I don't. So I have to build it."
He visualized the Silhouette of the Pirate Hunter (Zoro).
Lift. Grunt. Pain.
The lust didn't vanish, but it was being shoveled into the furnace of his ambition.
4. The Bridge Encounter (The Warning)
Timeline: Few days later. After school.
Ariel was walking home with Issei. They were acting like normal high school friends, talking about girls.
Issei: "Man, Rias Gremory looked at me today! I swear!"
Ariel: "She looked at the window behind you, Issei. I checked the vector of her gaze. We're invisible to her."
They reached the pedestrian bridge. A girl was waiting.
Yuuma Amano (Raynare). She was beautiful, dark-haired, and shy.
She walked up to Issei.
Yuuma: "Um... excuse me. Are you Hyoudou Issei?"
Issei froze. Ariel froze.
Ariel's Internal Monologue: No way. Issei? The guy who tripped over his own pants in gym class? Why him? Why not me?
Envy flared hot in Ariel's chest. He was fitter than Issei (slightly). He was smarter.
But then, his MND (Perception) caught something.
It wasn't "Haki" yet. It was just a gut instinct derived from studying the Mercenary archives (God of Blackfield).
Something is wrong.
She's too perfect. Her body language is rehearsed. She's looking at Issei like a butcher looks at a pig.
Yuuma: "Will you... go out with me?"
Issei screamed in joy. "YES! YES I WILL!"
Issei turned to Ariel, tears of joy streaming down his face. "Ariel! Did you hear that?! I got a girlfriend!"
Ariel looked at his friend. He saw the pure, innocent joy on Issei's face.
The envy vanished, replaced by Fearless Honesty.
Ariel: "Issei... congratulations."
He turned to Yuuma. He looked her dead in the eye. He didn't smile.
Ariel: "Take care of him. He's an idiot, but he's a good guy. If you're pranking him, or if this is some kind of game... I won't laugh."
Yuuma’s smile twitched for a micro-second. She sensed... something. Not power. But Intent.
Yuuma: "O-of course not! I really like him!"
Ariel nodded slowly. "Okay then."
5. The Date Prep (The Inferiority Peaks)
Timeline: Sunday. The day of the date.
Ariel was alone in his apartment. Issei was out on a date.
Ariel tried to peep. He tried to think about Rias Gremory.
But he couldn't focus. He was worried.
"Why am I worried? I should be jealous. I should be hating him."
"But the Mercenary instincts... the 'Sense' I'm trying to learn... it's screaming."
He stood up.
He accessed the PTD.
"System. I need to learn Observation. Not the advanced stuff. Just... Intent Sensing. I need to know if my friend is walking into a trap."
> Observer: "Training initiated. Blindfold Protocol. Dodge the baseball."
> 
Ariel spent the afternoon getting hit by baseballs in the VR, trying to feel the "Intent" of the thrower.
He failed. He got bruised.
But slowly, he started to stop looking with his eyes and start looking with his Gut.
Evening came.
Ariel felt a cold chill.
Issei is in trouble.
He didn't know about Fallen Angels. He didn't know about Sacred Gears.
He just knew his friend was with a girl who smiled with her mouth but not her eyes.
Ariel grabbed a hoodie to cover his slightly-chunky frame.
"I'm going. I'm not the hero. I'm the perverted friend. But perverts look out for each other."
He ran toward the park.
🚦 Narrative Checkpoint
Changes Implemented:
 * Perversion: Ariel actively participated in the peeping but felt shame (Koneko interaction).
 * Inferiority: He is openly jealous of Issei getting Yuuma, but his friendship/truthfulness overrides it.
 * No Plot Knowledge: He has no idea Yuuma is a Fallen Angel. He suspects she is a "Prankster" or a "Bully."
 * Motivation: He runs to the park not to save the world, but to stop his friend from getting his heart broken (literally, though he doesn't know that).
Your Move:
We are approaching the Raynare Intervention.

## 📕 Chapter 2: The Glitch and The Iron Skin
Timeline: Monday Morning (The day after the murder).
Location: Ariel’s Apartment / Kuoh Academy.
1. The Memory Glitch (The PTD Intervention)
Ariel woke up in his bed. His head felt like it had been split open with an axe.
The sunlight streaming through the window felt blinding.
"Ugh... what happened?" Ariel groaned, rubbing his temples. "I had a nightmare. Issei got a girlfriend... and she was a bird?"
A fog settled over his mind. A soothing, magical compulsion whispered to him: It was just a dream. You went to the park, got tired, and came home. Nothing happened.
Ariel’s eyes glazed over. "Right. Just a dream. I need coffee."
He sat up. But as his feet touched the floor, a blue holographic window slammed open in his vision, shattering the magical fog.
> Observer: "ALERT. External Psionic Interference Detected. Source: Devil Magic (Memory Wipe). Integrity Check... Failed. Initiating Veritas Protocol."
> Observer: "Restoring Deleted File: [The_Red_Sunset.mp4]"
> 
Ariel gasped, clutching his chest. The memory didn't come back gently; it flooded him.
The black wings. The light spear punching through Issei. The scream. Rias Gremory's red hair.
"It was real," Ariel whispered, the blood draining from his face. "She tried to erase it. She tried to make me an NPC again."
He looked at his hands. They were shaking. Not from magic, but from the lingering terror of realizing how small he was.
2. The Replay (The Motivation)
"System," Ariel commanded, his voice trembling but firm. "Play the footage. Third-person view."
The PTD projected the scene in his living room.
Ariel watched himself run out from behind the vending machine.
He saw himself scream.
He saw Raynare flinch.
But mostly, he saw how pathetic he looked. He was panting, his stance was wide and clumsy, and his legs were wobbling. If Raynare had thrown a second spear, he would have died instantly.
"I didn't save him," Ariel admitted (Veritas). "I just startled her. It was luck. Next time, luck won't be enough."
He clenched his fist.
"She tried to wipe my mind because I'm weak. Because I'm a civilian. I need to be something harder to break."
3. The First Grind: Iron Body (Tekkai / Armament)
Ariel didn't go to breakfast. He went into the PTD.
"System. I need defense. I can't dodge light speed yet. I need to take a hit."
He pulled up the One Piece Archive. He looked at the concept of Tekkai (Iron Body) and Armament Haki.
> Observer: "Warning. Haki requires Spirit (SPR). You have SPR 0.1. You cannot manifest invisible armor yet. Suggestion: Physical Conditioning Phase."
> 
"Fine," Ariel snapped. "Load the Blunt Force Trauma module. Low level. Bamboo swords."
The Simulation:
Ariel stood in a digital dojo.
Mission: Tighten the muscles at the exact moment of impact to distribute force.
Whack.
A digital bamboo sword slammed into his ribs.
"GAH!" Ariel buckled.
"Again."
Whack.
"Focus! Don't flinch away. Lean into it! Make the muscle dense!"
He spent two hours getting beaten black and blue in the simulation. The pain was real (simulated neuro-response), but his physical body remained uninjured.
By the end, he wasn't "Hardened" yet, but his flinch response was gone. He learned to lock his core instantly upon seeing an attack.
[Status Update: PHY 0.8 \rightarrow 0.9 (Pain Tolerance Increased)]
4. The School Confrontation
Ariel arrived at Kuoh Academy late. He looked exhausted, eyes shadowed, but his walk was different. He wasn't looking at the ground anymore.
He found Issei behind the gymnasium during lunch.
Issei looked terrible. Pale, shaky, staring at nothing. The "Perverted Trio" were trying to show him a dirty magazine, but Issei wasn't reacting.
"Issei," Ariel said, walking up.
Issei jumped. "A-Ariel! Hey! Man, I had the weirdest dream last night..."
Issei laughed nervously, clutching his chest where the spear had hit. "I dreamt I got a girlfriend and then... woke up in bed. Crazy, right?"
Rias Gremory’s magic was working on him. Issei was trying to rewrite the trauma as a nightmare.
Ariel grabbed Issei’s wrist. He squeezed hard.
"It wasn't a dream, Issei."
Issei froze. "W-what?"
Ariel leaned in, lowering his voice.
"Yuuma Amano. The black wings. The fountain turning red. You asked her why."
Issei’s eyes dilated. The magic barrier in his mind cracked under the weight of Ariel's Truth.
"You... you were there?" Issei whispered, trembling. "But... the red-haired girl... she said..."
"She lied," Ariel said bluntly. "She fixed you, but she tried to delete the memory so you wouldn't be scared. But I saw it. I saw you die."
Issei’s knees gave out. He slid down the gym wall, burying his face in his hands. "It was real? She... she really killed me?"
Ariel sat down next to him. He didn't offer false comfort. He offered solidarity.
"Yeah. It was real. We were weak. We were prey."
Ariel looked at his own hand—the hand he had been hardening in the simulation all morning.
"But I'm not forgetting it, Issei. And I'm not going to be prey again. You shouldn't either."
5. The Red Observer
High above them, in the windows of the Old School Building, Rias Gremory watched.
She held a Rook chess piece in her hand.
"Akeno," Rias said, her voice sharp.
"Yes, Buchou?" Akeno stepped out of the shadows.
"The memory wipe failed on the Veritas boy. He just broke Issei's conditioning."
Akeno giggled, but her eyes were dangerous. "Ara ara. That's impossible for a normal human. Should I... correct it?"
Rias narrowed her eyes, watching Ariel pat Issei on the back.
"No. He didn't panic. He didn't run to the police. He's... steadying him. Leave him for now. But keep an eye on him. If he has a resistance to magic... he might be a Variable."
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Memory Wipe resisted. Training initiated (Iron Body Basics). Friendship with Issei deepened through shared trauma.
 * Issei: Trauma acknowledged. Trust in Ariel established.
 * Rias: Suspicion aroused. Ariel is now on the "Watch List."

## 📕 Chapter 3: The Park and the Panic (Conditioning)
Timeline: Tuesday Afternoon (After School).
Location: Kuoh Town Park (The scene of the crime).
1. The Return to the Scene
Ariel dragged Issei to the park. Issei was digging his heels in, looking pale.
"Dude, seriously? Why here? This is where... you know..." Issei whispered, looking around nervously for black feathers.
"Exactly," Ariel said, dropping his school bag on a bench. "This is where you almost died. This is where we froze."
Ariel took off his blazer, revealing a slightly-overweight but determined frame. He started stretching.
"We aren't here to ghost-hunt, Issei. We're here to make sure that if something does show up, we can run faster than it."
Issei rubbed his chest. The phantom pain of the light spear was still there.
"Run? You stood your ground yesterday."
"And my knees were shaking so bad I almost wet myself," Ariel admitted (Veritas). "I wasn't brave, Issei. I was stupid. Being brave means being ready. Drop and give me twenty."
Issei stared at him. "Twenty? I can barely do five!"
"Then do five. Then do five more. Do you want to be a victim again?"
Issei looked at the fountain. He remembered the cold eyes of Raynare.
He dropped to the ground.
"Fine. But if I puke, it's on you."
2. The Physical Grind (Hidden Intent)
For the next hour, Ariel ran Issei through a grueling, albeit basic, circuit. Sprints, pushups, squats.
Ariel struggled too. His PHY 0.9 was better than Issei's, but he was still soft. They were two sweaty, wheezing teenagers struggling against their own mediocrity.
Issei: (Gasping) "Why... are we doing... burpees? This won't stop... a light spear."
Ariel: (Panting) "No. But it builds... tolerance. You panicked, Issei. Your body froze because it wasn't used to stress. We are inducing stress... so your brain learns to function through it."
This was the Mental Hardening disguised as exercise. Ariel was teaching Issei to keep thinking while his heart rate was at 180bpm.
3. The "Gut Check" (Observation Basics)
As the sun began to set, casting long shadows, Ariel decided to try the subtle training. He couldn't say "Use Haki." He had to use logic.
He picked up a small rubber ball he'd brought.
Ariel: "Okay. Cool down. Stand over there. Close your eyes."
Issei: "Why? Is this a trust game?"
Ariel: "No. It's a 'Don't Get Hit' game. Keep your eyes closed. I'm going to throw this ball at you. Not hard. Just toss it."
Issei: "I can't dodge if I can't see!"
Ariel: "You couldn't see the spear either, could you?"
Issei flinched. That hit home.
"Fine." He closed his eyes. He looked tense, shoulders hunched up to his ears.
Ariel: "Relax. Don't listen for the ball. Listen to the air. Feel the pressure changing. When you feel like something is wrong... move."
Ariel tossed the ball. Gently.
Bonk. It hit Issei in the forehead.
"Ow!" Issei opened his eyes. "See?! Impossible!"
Ariel: "Again. You were waiting for the impact. Don't wait for the pain. Wait for the intent."
They did it again. And again.
Bonk. Bonk. Bonk.
Issei was getting frustrated. "This is stupid, Ariel! I'm just a normal guy! I don't have superpowers!"
Ariel paused. He felt a prickle on his neck. His MND 1.2 (plus his paranoid focus on Observation) picked up a signal.
Someone was watching them.
Not Raynare. Someone else. A calm, warm, but distinct presence near the tree line.
Is it the Devils? Rias? Ariel wondered. Or is it the next plot point?
Ariel: "Issei. Close your eyes one more time. Seriously."
Issei sighed but complied. "Last time."
Ariel didn't throw the ball immediately. He let the silence stretch. He watched the tree line.
He whispered, "Issei. Do you feel that?"
Issei: "Feel what? The wind?"
Ariel: "No. The feeling that we aren't alone."
Issei stiffened. "Don't joke, man."
Ariel: "I'm not joking. Focus on that feeling. That creepy crawl on your neck. That's your Gut. That's your radar. Hold onto that fear. Use it."
Ariel threw the ball. Harder this time.
Issei, heightened by the sudden fear of being watched, flinched. He jerked his head to the left.
The ball whizzed past his ear.
Issei’s eyes snapped open. "Whoa! I... I moved!"
Ariel smiled. It was clumsy, it was fear-based, but it was a start.
"See? You're not just a normal guy, Issei. You've got survival instincts. You just need to tune the radio."
4. The Interrupt
Before they could celebrate, a soft rustling came from the bushes—the same area Ariel had sensed the presence.
Issei panicked, jumping behind Ariel. "It's the bird lady! She's back!"
Ariel braced himself, locking his core (Iron Body attempt), ready to take a hit.
But no spear came out.
Instead, a small, blonde girl in a nun's habit stumbled out of the bushes. She looked lost, clutching a small suitcase, and tripped over a tree root.
Girl: "Ouchie..."
Issei blinked. "A... nun?"
Ariel exhaled, his tension draining instantly. He recognized the plot.
Asia Argento.
She looked up, tears in her eyes, rubbing her scraped knee. She radiated a soft, golden aura that even Ariel's weak senses could feel as "Kindness."
Ariel's Internal Monologue: So that was the presence. Not a threat. A trigger.
Ariel stepped forward, extending a hand. He decided to be Veritas.
"You're not a monster," Ariel said, his voice gentle. "You're just clumsy. Are you okay?"
Asia looked up at Ariel, then at Issei.
"Oh... hello. I seem to be lost. Could you... help me?"
Issei, seeing a cute girl in trouble, immediately forgot his trauma. The "Pervert" override kicked in.
Issei: "A lost nun! It is my duty as a gentleman to assist! I am Hyoudou Issei!"
Ariel sighed, picking up his school bag. The training was over. The plot had arrived.
📈 Status Update
 * Issei: Physically exhausted. successfully dodged 1 ball due to fear/instinct. Met Asia.
 * Ariel: Confirmed basic teaching method works. Sensed Asia before seeing her (Low-level Observation success).
 * The Training: Established as a routine.

## 📕 Chapter 3 (Continued): The Golden Aura and the Red Flag
Location: Kuoh Town Park (Nightfall).
1. The Introduction
Issei was already dusting off Asia’s habit, his face flushed red.
"Are you hurt, Sister? That was a nasty fall! I'm Issei, and this grumpy guy is Ariel. We're students at Kuoh Academy!"
Asia smiled, a radiant, gentle expression that seemed to light up the dim park.
"It is nice to meet you, Issei-san, Ariel-san. I am Asia Argento. I arrived in Japan today, but... I seem to have lost my map."
Ariel stood back, his arms crossed. He wasn't looking at Asia's face (though he noted she was objectively cute). He was looking at the air around her.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
Okay, gut check. MND 1.2. What am I seeing?
1. She’s a nun. In a town controlled by Devils (based on Rias).
2. She’s alone at night. No luggage except a small bag.
3. That feeling...
He focused on his "Gut." It wasn't the cold, sharp spike he felt with Raynare. It was warm. It felt like soup on a cold day.
She's not the threat. She feels... good. Too good.
But then, the prickle on his neck returned. The same feeling that preceded Raynare’s spear.
Someone is watching her. She isn't the predator. She's the bait.
2. The Veritas Interruption
Issei was busy offering to walk her anywhere she needed.
"I can take you to a hotel! Or the station!"
"Issei, stop," Ariel said, his voice cutting through the flirting like a knife.
Issei froze. "What? Dude, don't be rude."
Ariel stepped into Asia’s personal space—not aggressively, but with purpose. He looked her dead in the eye.
"Asia-san. You said you just arrived. Where are the rest of them?"
Asia blinked, confused. "The rest...?"
"The other nuns. The priests. Your handlers," Ariel listed bluntly. "The Church doesn't just drop a teenage girl in a foreign country alone at night with no map. That doesn't happen. Who picked you up from the airport?"
Asia looked down, fidgeting with her fingers. "I... I was told to make my way to the church assignment alone. It is a test of... self-reliance."
"That's not a test," Ariel said, his voice dropping lower. "That's negligence. Or a setup."
Issei frowned. "Ariel, you're scaring her!"
"I'm trying to," Ariel shot back. "Because if she's scared, she might pay attention."
He turned back to Asia.
"Which church? The one near the station is Catholic, but they lock the gates at 6 PM. You're walking toward the forest district."
Asia pointed a trembling finger toward the dark treeline on the hill.
"That one. The old church on the hill."
Ariel and Issei both froze. Even Issei knew the rumors.
"The abandoned one?" Issei whispered. "Dude, that place is haunted. Like, actually haunted."
Ariel felt the prickle on his neck intensify into a burn.
The Abandoned Church. Raynare had black wings. Fallen Angels. A 'haunted' church. It fits.
3. The Warning
Ariel grabbed Issei’s shoulder and pulled him back a step.
"Issei. Listen to me. My gut is screaming."
"About her?" Issei asked.
"About where she's going. And who is watching." Ariel scanned the trees. He couldn't see them yet—his Observation wasn't high enough—but he knew they were there.
He turned to Asia.
"Asia. I'm going to be honest with you because nobody else will. You are walking into a bad situation."
Asia looked at him with wide, innocent eyes. "But... I must go. It is God's will."
"Does God usually ask you to walk into condemned buildings in the middle of the night?" Ariel asked.
Asia flinched. "I... I have nowhere else to go. Even if it is scary... I have to follow orders."
Ariel saw the resignation in her eyes. It was the look of someone used to being used. It made him angry. Not jealous-angry. Righteous-angry.
She's a NPC walking into a death script, Ariel thought. Just like Issei was.
4. The Decision
Ariel sighed, running a hand through his hair.
"Fine. We're not letting you walk there alone."
Issei pumped his fist. "Exactly! We'll escort you! The Perverted... uh, the Gentleman Duo will protect you!"
Ariel glared at Issei. "We are walking her to the gate. We are not going inside. Issei, if you see anything black, or glowing, or feathery... you run. You don't ask questions. You run."
Issei gulped, remembering the spear. "Got it. Run."
Ariel looked at the treeline where he felt the gaze. He projected his "Intent" again—that raw, messy shout of defiance he used on Raynare. He didn't scream out loud this time. He just thought it, loudly.
WE SEE YOU.
The pressure on his neck eased slightly. The watchers were amused, or patient.
"Let's go," Ariel said, taking point. "Stay close."
5. The Walk (Observation Training in Practice)
They walked through the town, Issei chatting happily with Asia about Japanese food, trying to distract her from the scary destination.
Ariel walked two paces behind them.
He wasn't chatting. He was Grinding.
Focus on the footsteps.
Focus on the wind.
Is that a cat, or a spy?
He was forcing his brain to process sensory input at a rate it wasn't designed for. His head throbbed.
[System Update: MND 1.2 \rightarrow 1.25 (Sensory Overload)]
They reached the rusty gates of the abandoned church. The air was cold. It smelled of mold and... something metallic. Blood? Or just rust?
Asia bowed to them. "Thank you, Issei-san, Ariel-san. You are very kind. I... I have never had friends walk me home before."
She smiled. It was a sad, lonely smile.
Issei looked like he wanted to cry. "Asia-chan... if you ever need anything..."
"Don't go inside," Ariel interrupted.
Asia looked at him.
"Ariel-san?"
"If you go inside there," Ariel said, pointing at the rotting doors, "you're going to get hurt. I don't have proof. I just know."
He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper only she could hear.
"If they hurt you... run back to the park. We'll be there."
Asia’s eyes widened. She sensed his Veritas. He wasn't trying to scare her; he was giving her an exit strategy.
"I... I will remember. Thank you."
She turned and walked into the darkness of the church grounds. The heavy doors creaked shut.
6. The Retreat
Issei stared at the door. "We can't just leave her, Ariel! That place is creepy!"
"We can't fight ghosts with bare hands, Issei," Ariel said, grabbing Issei's collar and dragging him away. "We need to get stronger. Fast."
As they walked away, Ariel looked back one last time.
He saw a silhouette on the church steeple. A figure with black wings.
It was watching them.
Ariel didn't look away. He glared.
I see you, Raynare. You missed me once. You won't get a second free shot.
[System Alert: Threat Level - High. Adrenaline Spike. Iron Body Reflex Triggered.]
Ariel’s muscles tightened instinctively. He was learning.
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Confirmed Asia is bait. Identified the enemy location. Verified his "Gut Sense" is working.
 * Issei: Emotional attachment to Asia established. Motivated to protect her.
 * The Enemy: Aware of the two human witnesses, but dismissing them as harmless for now.

## 📕 Chapter 3 (Continued): The Fool's Choice
Location: The Gate of the Abandoned Church.
1. The Roger Moment
Issei stood his ground, his fists clenched at his sides.
"I can't do it, Ariel. Look at this place. It's a graveyard. If we leave her here, and something happens... I won't be able to sleep. I won't be able to look at myself in the mirror!"
Ariel looked at Issei. He saw the fear in his friend's eyes, but also the stubbornness.
Ariel’s logical brain (MND) was screaming: Run. Survival probability is less than 10%. You are civilians.
But his soul (SPR) remembered the Archive.
He remembered Gold Roger. “If I take one step back now, I feel like all the oaths I’ve made, all the dreams I’ve had... will crumble.”
He remembered Luffy. “If I can't protect my friends, I don't deserve to be King!”
Ariel let out a long, frustrated sigh. He slapped his own cheeks.
Ariel: "You're an idiot, Issei."
Issei: "I know."
Ariel: "And I'm an even bigger idiot for listening to you."
Ariel dropped his school bag near the bushes. He rolled up his sleeves.
Ariel: "Fine. We go in. But we stick together. If we see a monster, we don't fight to win. We fight to escape with her. Understood?"
Issei nodded vigorously. "Understood!"
Ariel looked at the dark church.
Logic says run. But Legends don't look at the odds.
"Let's go."
2. The Sanctuary of Rot
They pushed open the heavy wooden doors. Creaaaak.
The inside of the church was a hollow shell. Moonlight streamed through broken stained glass, illuminating dust motes and rotting pews. A large crucifix hung crookedly above the altar.
At the front, kneeling in prayer, was Asia.
She looked tiny in the vast, empty dark.
"Asia!" Issei whispered, his voice echoing too loudly.
Asia turned, gasping. "Issei-san? Ariel-san? Why... why did you follow me? It is forbidden!"
They walked down the aisle. Ariel’s senses were on fire. The air tasted like iron.
Ariel: "We're walking you to your room, Asia. Or to your superior. We just want to make sure you're safe."
"Safe?"
A maniacal, scratching voice echoed from the shadows of the confessional booth.
"Ah, 'safe.' What a boring word for such a thrilling night!"
3. The Stray Exorcist
A man stepped out of the shadows. He wore priest vestments, but his hair was white and wild, and his smile was too wide. He held a sword in one hand and a light-gun in the other.
Freed Sellzen.
Freed: "Visitors! And male ones! Are you here to confess? I hope you have some juicy sins. I love sins!"
Asia shrank back. "Freed-san... these are my friends. Please..."
Freed: "Friends? Trash, you mean! Filthy, stray trash sniffing around my playground!"
Ariel stepped in front of Issei and Asia.
Ariel's Internal Monologue: Human. He's human. No wings. I can fight this.
Ariel: "We're leaving. We're taking her with us."
Freed laughed, a high-pitched cackle. "Taking her? But the Fallen Ones need her gear! And I... I need to cut something!"
Freed moved. He was fast—faster than a normal human.
He lunged at Ariel with the sword.
Ariel: "Issei, back!"
4. The Test of Iron (Tekkai vs. Steel)
Ariel didn't have time to dodge. Freed was moving at trained combat speeds.
Ariel saw the blade coming down toward his shoulder.
I can't dodge. I have to tank it.
He remembered the PTD training. Tighten. Dense. Reject the impact.
Ariel planted his feet. He locked his core muscles. He flexed his trapezius and shoulder muscles into a rock-hard knot.
Ariel: (Internal Scream) IRON BODY!
CLANG.
The sword hit Ariel’s shoulder.
It didn't bounce off like Superman. Ariel wasn't there yet.
But it didn't slice his arm off.
The blade bit into the skin, drawing blood, but it stopped at the muscle. The density of Ariel's conditioned frame caught the blade before it hit the bone.
Freed: "Hah?!"
Ariel: "GAH!"
Ariel gritted his teeth through the blinding pain. He grabbed Freed's sword arm with his own bleeding hand.
Ariel: "Issei! PUNCH HIM!"
Issei, fueled by adrenaline and horror at seeing Ariel cut, roared.
Issei: "DON'T TOUCH MY FRIEND!"
He charged. He didn't have the Boosted Gear active, but he had the strength of a desperate teenager. He tackled Freed, slamming his fist into the priest's face.
Freed stumbled back, wrenching his sword free. Blood sprayed from Ariel’s shoulder.
5. The Retreat
Freed wiped blood from his lip. He looked... delighted.
Freed: "Oh! Oh, wonderful! You bleed! You fight! This is much better than praying!"
He raised his light-gun.
Freed: "Now... dance for me!"
Bang! Bang!
Bullets of light tore up the floorboards.
Ariel clutched his bleeding shoulder. He knew they couldn't win this. Freed was playing with them.
Ariel: "Issei! Grab Asia! We're running! NOW!"
Asia: "No! Please! If you take me, they'll kill you! I have to stay!"
Asia stood between Freed and the boys, spreading her arms. Her healing twilight aura flared green.
Asia: "Run! I promise I'll be fine! Please, don't die for me!"
Issei hesitated. "But—"
Freed: "Aww, a martyr! How cute! I'll kill them first, then we can play, nun!"
Freed prepared a lethal dash.
Ariel saw the killing intent. He knew Issei wouldn't move unless forced.
Ariel grabbed Issei by the collar with his good arm.
Ariel: "We aren't leaving her! We're getting reinforcements! MOVE!"
Ariel dragged Issei toward the door.
He looked back at Freed. He projected his Intent one last time—a desperate, bloody glare.
Ariel: We will be back.
Freed paused, amused by the glare. "Run, little piggies! Run home!"
They burst out of the church doors and sprinted into the woods, leaving Asia behind in the darkness.
6. The Fallout
They collapsed at the edge of the park. Ariel was pale, his shirt soaked in blood.
Issei was crying, slamming his fist into the dirt.
Issei: "We left her! We ran away again!"
Ariel leaned against a tree, breathing heavily. The pain in his shoulder was white-hot.
Ariel: "We didn't run away, Issei. We survived."
He looked at the cut. It was deep, but the muscle held. Iron Body worked. Barely.
"We know where she is. We know who has her. And now..."
Ariel’s eyes hardened. The "Pervert" was gone. The "Loser" was gone.
"...we know we can bleed them."
Issei: "Ariel... your shoulder..."
Ariel: "It's fine. Pain is just data. Listen to me, Issei. Tomorrow, we aren't going to school. We're going to war."
📈 Status Update
 * Narrative Impact: They entered. They fought. They failed, but they survived.
 * Ariel: PHY 0.9 proven insufficient for offense, but Iron Body (Tekkai) prevented fatal injury. Current Status: Injured (Left Shoulder).
 * Issei: Guilt maxed out. Motivation to fight is now personal.
 * The Enemy: Freed knows their faces. Raynare likely knows they are active. The timeline has accelerated.

## 📕 Chapter 4: The Long Night (Bio-Feedback & The Dragon's Pulse)
Timeline: Wednesday Night (Immediately after escaping the Church).
Location: Ariel’s Apartment.
1. The Triage
They burst into Ariel’s apartment. Ariel collapsed onto the cheap linoleum floor, his left arm useless, blood dripping steadily.
Issei: "I'm calling an ambulance! Or Rias! We need magic!"
Ariel: "No!" Ariel gritted his teeth, sitting up against the wall. "No hospitals. Raynare might have watchers there. And no Rias. If she saves us again, she might wipe our memories for real this time. We do this ourselves."
Ariel pointed to the bathroom.
"First aid kit. Under the sink. Get the rubbing alcohol, a needle, and a lighter."
Issei looked pale, but the command cut through his panic. He rushed to get the supplies.
2. The Surgery (Veritas)
Issei came back, hands shaking.
Issei: "Dude, I can't stitch you up! I'll mess it up!"
Ariel: "You have to. I can't use my right hand to stitch my left shoulder. Focus, Issei. Pretend it's a model kit. Just... wetter."
Ariel poured the alcohol over the wound. He bit down on a leather belt to keep from screaming. The pain was blinding, white-hot data flooding his brain.
Ariel's Internal Monologue (PTD Active):
> Observer: "Pain levels critical. Adrenaline fading. Shock imminent. Suggestion: Bio-Feedback Regulation."
> 
Ariel closed his eyes. He didn't enter the VR world; he overlaid the PTD's schematics onto his own body in his mind's eye. He visualized his veins. He visualized the nerve clusters.
Ariel: "Do it, Issei. Stitch."
As Issei worked—clumsily, terrified, crying—Ariel didn't scream. He breathed.
Inhale (4 seconds). Hold (7 seconds). Exhale (8 seconds).
He used the concept of Life Return (Seimei Kikan) from One Piece and Total Concentration Breathing from Demon Slayer. He couldn't control his hair or digestion yet, but he could force his heart rate down. He willed his platelets to clot. He commanded his pain receptors to mute.
Ariel: "Stop shaking, Issei. You're doing fine."
Issei tied the final knot. He slumped back, covered in his friend's blood.
Issei: "You're insane. You didn't even flinch."
Ariel: "I flinched on the inside."
3. The Awakening of the Dragon
Ariel bandaged the wound tight. He felt weak, but stable.
He looked at Issei. Issei was staring at his own hands, consumed by guilt.
Issei: "I froze. Again. You took a sword for me. Asia is gone because I couldn't do anything."
Ariel stood up, swaying slightly. He walked over and kicked Issei’s leg.
Ariel: "Stop pitying yourself. It's boring."
Issei looked up, angry. "Boring?! We almost died!"
Ariel: "And tomorrow, we're going back. So you have tonight to figure out how to be useful."
Ariel grabbed Issei’s left hand—the hand where the Sacred Gear lived.
Ariel: "That thing on your hand. It appeared when you were dying. It appeared when you punched Freed. It reacts to Emotion."
Issei: "So? I can't control it! It just happens!"
Ariel: "Because you're waiting for it to happen. You're waiting for permission."
Ariel dragged Issei to the center of the room.
Ariel: "Freed is going to kill Asia tomorrow. He is going to enjoy it. Visualize that."
Issei squeezed his eyes shut. "Stop it!"
Ariel: "Visualize it! The sword cutting her! Raynare laughing! Visualize me bleeding out on the floor because you were too slow!"
Issei: "SHUT UP!"
Ariel: "Don't tell me to shut up! Make me shut up!"
Ariel slapped Issei. Hard.
It was the catalyst. The guilt, the fear, the anger—it all coalesced into a single point of Desire.
I want to protect them.
A green light flashed.
[BOOST!]
The Red Gauntlet materialized on Issei's arm. It wasn't flickering this time. It was solid.
Issei panted, staring at the metal claw. "I... I did it."
Ariel: (Smiling, wiping blood from his lip) "There it is. That's the trigger. It's not magic, Issei. It's Will. You have to want it more than you fear the pain."
4. The Strategy Meeting
It was 3:00 AM. They sat on the floor, eating instant ramen. Ariel’s shoulder throbbed, but his mind was clear.
Ariel: "Okay. Here's the intel. We have Freed (Speed/Sword), Raynare (Light Spear/Flight), and probably 2-3 other Fallen Angels (Support)."
Issei: "And we have... a guy with a sword wound and a guy with a glove."
Ariel: "We have the element of surprise. They think we're trash. They think we ran away terrified."
Ariel used his finger to draw a map on the dusty floor.
Ariel: "They'll be doing the ritual at the altar. Freed will be guarding the door.
Phase 1: You breach the front. You make noise. You draw Freed's attention. You have the Gauntlet; you can block his sword now."
Issei: "Me? Solo Freed? What about you?"
Ariel: "I'm the Variable. While you keep the psycho priest busy, I flank. I'm going for Asia. If I can get her out of the circle, the ritual stops."
Issei: "But Raynare..."
Ariel: "I have a plan for her. It's stupid, it's dangerous, and it relies on you hitting her really, really hard at the exact right second."
Ariel looked at his bandaged shoulder. He accessed his Status.
[PHY: 0.8 (Injured). Adrenaline Reserve: 100%. Will: Maximum.]
I can't use Iron Body again. My muscles are torn. I have to use Observation. I have to see the attack coming.
Ariel: "Get some sleep, Issei. Tomorrow, we crash a church."
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Wound stabilized (Bio-Feedback). PHY is compromised, but MND/SPR is sharpened by desperation.
 * Issei: Unlocked voluntary manifestation of Boosted Gear. Motivated by anger/protective instinct.

## 📕 Chapter 5: The Bait and The Builder
Timeline: Thursday Morning.
Location: Split (Kuoh Academy / Kuoh Hardware District).
1. The Morning Split
Ariel stood at the door of his apartment, handing Issei his school bag. Ariel was dressed in civilian clothes—cargo pants, a hoodie, and sturdy boots.
Issei: "You seriously want me to go to Math class while Asia is being tortured?!"
Ariel: "If we both vanish, they'll know we're planning something. They might speed up the ritual. You have to go, Issei. You have to look defeated. Look sad. Look scared. Make them think they won."
Issei clenched his jaw. "I hate acting."
Ariel: "It's not acting. You are scared. Use it. I need six hours to gather supplies. Meet me at the park at 4:00 PM. Don't engage the enemy. Just exist."
Issei nodded, turning to leave. "Don't get caught shopping, Ariel."
Ariel: "I'm a ghost."
2. Issei’s Mission: The Trap at School
Location: Kuoh Academy, Lunch Break.
Issei sat at his desk, staring at the empty seat where Asia should have been. The guilt was eating him alive.
The Perverted Trio tried to cheer him up, but their voices sounded distant.
"Hyoudou-kun?"
A voice called him from the hallway. A tall, beautiful upperclassman with dark blue hair. Kalawarner. And beside her, a girl in gothic lolita fashion. Mittelt.
They were in disguise, but Issei’s Gut Instinct (the training from yesterday) screamed.
The air feels cold. Like Raynare.
He walked out. "Who are you?"
Mittelt giggled. "Aww, he looks like a kicked puppy! Raynare was right, you're pathetic."
Kalawarner leaned against the wall, smiling cruelly. "We just came to see the face of the boy who abandoned his friend. The ritual happens at sunset, Hyoudou. If you want to hear her scream one last time, feel free to listen from the bottom of the hill."
Issei’s hand twitched. He wanted to summon the Gear. He wanted to punch them.
But Ariel’s voice echoed in his head: Make them think they won.
Issei forced his head down. He trembled.
"Just... leave me alone."
Mittelt laughed. "Boring! Let's go, Kalawarner. He's broken."
They walked away, confident that Issei Hyoudou was a non-threat.
As soon as they turned the corner, Issei looked up. His eyes weren't broken. They were burning.
You messed up. You just confirmed the time.
3. Ariel’s Mission: The Hardware Store War
Location: "Don Quijote" Discount Store / Hardware Store.
Ariel pushed a shopping cart. He was calculating budget and chemical reactions in his head (MND active).
I can't buy guns. I can't buy explosives. I have to use household physics.
He grabbed items off the shelves with precision:
 * Four bags of Flour: Fine powder. Flammable if dispersed. Dust explosion or visual cover.
 * Industrial Lubricant: Freed relies on speed. If the floor is zero-friction, he can't dash.
 * High-Lumen Flashlights (Strobe function): Raynare flies. I need to blind her.
 * Pepper Spray (Bear deterrent grade): Biological warfare. Demons still have eyes and lungs.
 * Fishing Line (High tensile): Tripwires.
Ariel paid with cash to avoid a digital trail. He walked out, his backpack heavy.
He wasn't a warrior yet. He was a Trapper.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
I don't have Haki yet. I don't have magic. But I have science. And science doesn't care if you're a Fallen Angel. If you can't see, you can't fight.
4. The Rendezvous and The Plan
Location: The Park, 4:00 PM.
Issei sprinted into the park. Ariel was already there, taping flares together into a bundle.
Issei: "They came to the school! Sunset! That's the deadline!"
Ariel: "Perfect. That gives us an hour to set up the breach."
Ariel tossed a tactical vest (bought from a surplus store) to Issei.
Ariel: "Put this on. It won't stop a light spear, but it'll hold your ammo."
Issei: "Ammo?"
Ariel handed him the flour bombs (flour inside balloons) and the flashlights.
Ariel: "Listen carefully, Issei. Here is the breach plan.
Step 1: I cut the power to the church. Darkness is our ally.
Step 2: You kick the door. Throw the flour. I ignite it with a flare. Flashbang.
Step 3: In the confusion, you tackle Freed. I go for Asia."
Issei looked at the improvised arsenal. It looked ridiculous. A bag of flour and a flashlight?
But looking at Ariel’s face—calm, scarred, and terrifyingly serious—Issei believed it would work.
Issei: "Let's crash a wedding."
Ariel: "Let's go be the villains."
They walked toward the hill. The sun was setting, painting the sky the color of blood.
The Mortal Variable and the Red Dragon were ready for war.
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Prepared with "Batman-tier" improvised gadgets. PHY is compromised (shoulder), but Tactical Advantage is high.
 * Issei: Rage is fully stoked by the school taunt. Motivation is at 100%.
 * The Enemy: Overconfident and expecting no resistance.

## 📕 Chapter 6: The Dust and the Devil
Timeline: Thursday Evening (Sunset).
Location: The Abandoned Church.
1. The Setup (0-Hour)
The sky outside was a bruised purple. Inside the church, the chanting had begun. It was a low, dissonant hum that vibrated in Issei’s teeth.
Ariel and Issei stood at the massive double doors.
Ariel checked his watch. 06:02 PM.
He looked at the rusted fuse box on the exterior wall. He had already cut the padlock with bolt cutters.
Ariel: (Whispering) "Remember the timing. Three seconds after the lights die, you breach. Don't hesitate."
Issei: (Sweating, clutching the flour balloons) "I got it. Kick. Throw. Duck."
Ariel reached into the fuse box. He didn't just flip the switch; he ripped the main copper wiring out with his gloved hand to ensure the power couldn't be turned back on.
Spark.
The hum of the electric lights inside died instantly.
Inside the Church:
"What the—?" Freed’s voice echoed.
"A power outage? Now?" Mittelt complained. "Ugh, humans and their shoddy infrastructure."
Ariel: "Now."
2. The Entry (The Dust Explosion)
Issei roared, channeling all his fear into his right leg.
Issei: "GRAAAH!"
CRASH!
The double doors flew open, splintering off their hinges.
The sudden noise silenced the chanting. In the dim twilight filtering through the stained glass, the Fallen Angels looked toward the entrance, confused.
Freed: "A pizza delivery? I didn't order—"
Issei didn't stop to talk. He hurled four water balloons filled with high-grade baking flour into the center of the aisle.
They burst on impact, sending a massive, choking white cloud of fine particulate matter into the air.
"What is this? Dust?" Raynare scoffed from above.
Ariel stepped into the doorway. He was wearing welding goggles. He held a lit road flare in his good hand.
Ariel: "Science lesson."
He tossed the flare into the center of the white cloud.
Physics: Fine combustible powder + Oxygen + Ignition Source = Rapid Expansion.
BOOM.
A massive fireball erupted in the center of the church. It wasn't magical hellfire; it was a concussive wave of pressure and heat.
The shockwave blew the pews apart. The windows shattered inward.
Raynare and the other Fallen Angels were knocked out of the air by the sudden pressure change, tumbling to the ground.
3. The Slick Floor Trap
The church was now filled with thick grey smoke. The Fallen Angels were coughing, disoriented, their eyes stinging from the heat.
Freed: (Coughing) "You little rats! I'll skin you!"
Freed ignited his Light Sword. He saw Issei’s silhouette in the smoke.
Freed: "THERE YOU ARE!"
Freed activated his superhuman speed. He dashed forward, intending to blitz Issei before he could react.
This was exactly what Ariel had calculated.
Ariel: "Issei, step left."
Issei stepped left.
Freed’s foot hit the patch of floor right inside the door. The patch Ariel had doused in Industrial Lubricant jars he had smashed on the way in.
Slip.
Friction vanished.
Freed’s momentum, combined with zero traction, turned him into a projectile. His feet flew out from under him. He slammed face-first onto the stone floor with a sickening crunch, sliding past Issei like a hockey puck.
Freed: "GYAAAH! MY NOSE!"
4. The Brawl
Ariel moved. He wasn't charging Freed. He was moving through the smoke toward the altar, guided by the glowing green light of the ritual circle.
Ariel: "Issei! He's grounded! HIT HIM!"
Issei looked down at the sliding priest. He remembered the insults. He remembered Ariel bleeding.
Issei: "EAT THIS!"
[BOOST!]
Issei’s gauntlet flared. He didn't use technique. He used a haymaker.
SMASH.
He punched Freed in the back of the head while the priest was trying to stand up. Freed’s face was driven into the stone floor again, cracking the tiles.
Freed: (Muffled) "Impossible... beaten by... lube..."
5. The Ascent to the Altar
While Issei engaged Freed, Ariel sprinted toward the altar. The smoke was clearing, revealing the angry forms of the Fallen Angels.
Mittelt: "You! The human from yesterday!"
She raised her hand, summoning a light spear.
Ariel didn't have a weapon. He had Flashlights.
He pulled two high-lumen tactical strobes from his belt, set to maximum frequency pulse. He threw them at Mittelt's feet.
Strobe. Strobe. Strobe.
The erratic flashing light in the dark church disrupted Mittelt's vision. She shielded her eyes, her aim faltering.
"My eyes! It's annoying!"
Ariel vaulted over a broken pew. His shoulder screamed in agony, the stitches pulling tight, but he ignored it.
He reached the altar.
Asia was there, chained to a cross. She was conscious, but weak. Her Sacred Gear (Twilight Healing) was being forcibly extracted—a green aura flowing out of her and into the ritual circle.
Asia: "Ariel-san? Is that you?"
Ariel: "I told you we'd come back."
Ariel pulled out the bolt cutters. He snapped the chain on her left wrist.
Snap.
Raynare: "ENOUGH!"
A voice boomed from the rafters. The smoke swirled away as Raynare hovered above the altar, her black wings spread wide, her face twisted in fury.
She wasn't blinded anymore. And she was looking directly at Ariel.
Raynare: "Tricks. Toys. Cheap chemistry. Do you really think that makes you strong, human?"
She summoned two light spears this time.
One aimed at Issei (who was wrestling Freed).
One aimed at Ariel (who was cutting Asia's chains).
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
MND 1.2: Calculation.
Spear velocity: High.
Iron Body: Unavailable (Shoulder injured).
Gadgets: Out.
Option: Observation.
Ariel stopped cutting. He looked up. He closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, tuning out the chaos, the screaming, and the fire.
He searched for the Intent.
Feel the air. Feel the malice.
He felt a sharp pressure on his right cheek.
It's coming from the right.
Ariel: "MOVE!"
He didn't dodge away. He tackled Asia down, pulling her to the floor behind the altar.
THOOM.
The light spear impaled the stone where his head had been a millisecond ago.
[System Update: Observation Haki - Level 0.5 (Danger Sense) - Success.]
Ariel lay on top of Asia, shielding her from the debris. He looked up at the furious Fallen Angel.
He grinned. It was a bloody, desperate grin.
Ariel: "We got her out of the circle, Raynare! The ritual is paused!"
Raynare looked at the extraction flow. It had indeed stopped when Asia moved.
Her face contorted into pure demonic rage.
Raynare: "Kill them. Kill them all! Leave nothing but ash!"
The real battle had just begun.
📈 Status Update
 * Tactical Phase: Success. The breach worked. Freed is injured/disoriented. Ritual interrupted.
 * Ariel: Successfully used gadgets and basic Observation to survive the opening salvo. Current Status: Vulnerable (No more surprises).
 * Issei: Engaged in melee with a recovering Freed.
 * The Enemy: Enraged and fully active. They are done playing.

## 📕 Chapter 7: The Dragon's Eyes and The Human Shield
Timeline: Thursday Evening (The Battle in the Church).
Location: The Altar.
1. The Speed of Sin (Issei vs. Freed)
Freed recovered from the lubricant trap. He was bleeding from the nose, and his eyes were wide with psychotic rage. He wiped the blood and licked it.
Freed: "You dirty little monkeys! I'm going to carve you into confetti!"
He ignited his Light Sword and dashed. He was a blur.
Issei panicked. He couldn't track Freed.
"He's too fast! I can't see him!"
Ariel, still lying over Asia to shield her, looked up. He couldn't fight physically anymore—his shoulder was screaming, and he was exposed. But his Mind (MND) was active.
Ariel: "Stop looking with your eyes, Issei! Listen to me!"
Ariel focused. He forced his Observation (Danger Sense) to expand. He felt the sharp, jagged malice of Freed moving to the left.
Ariel: "Left! Low sweep! JUMP!"
Issei didn't think. He obeyed the command instantly. He jumped.
Freed’s blade slashed the air where Issei’s legs had been a split-second before.
Freed: "What?!"
Ariel: "Right! Overhead! BLOCK HIGH!"
Issei raised his Gauntlet.
CLANG.
The Light Sword slammed into the Boosted Gear. Sparks flew. Issei’s knees buckled, but he held the line.
Ariel: "He's off balance! PUNCH HIM IN THE GUT!"
[BOOST!]
Issei roared, driving his fist into Freed’s stomach. The armor crunched. Freed coughed bile and staggered back, wheezing.
Issei: "I... I hit him! I can fight him!"
Ariel: "Don't get cocky! Keep your guard up!"
2. The Wrath from Above
Raynare hovered above the altar, watching her Exorcist get beaten by a novice. Her patience snapped.
Raynare: "Useless trash. All of you."
She looked at Ariel. She realized the dynamic immediately. The Red Dragon was the muscle, but the human with the bandaged shoulder was the Brain. He was the one predicting the moves.
Raynare: "You first, 'Tactician'."
She raised her hand. She didn't summon a normal light spear. She summoned a heavy, condensed javelin of violet light, humming with lethal energy.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
MND Alert: Threat Incoming. Vector: Straight down. Speed: Mach 1.
Evasion: Impossible due to injury.
Defense: Iron Body unavailable.
Target: Me.
Ariel looked at Issei. Issei was busy keeping Freed back. If Ariel shouted, Issei would turn around and get stabbed in the back by Freed.
Ariel looked at Asia beneath him. If he dodged, the spear would hit her.
Choice: Run and live, or Stay and bleed.
Ariel grit his teeth. Veritas.
I said I wouldn't run.
Ariel: "Asia. Close your eyes."
Asia: "Ariel-san?"
Ariel stood up, straddling Asia to cover her completely. He looked up at Raynare. He didn't scream. He didn't beg. He just locked his good arm across his chest and Hardened his resolve (and his muscles) as much as his exhausted body could.
Raynare: "Die."
She threw the spear.
3. The Sacrifice
THOOM.
The sound was sickening. The light spear slammed into Ariel.
It didn't pierce his heart—he managed to shift slightly at the last second—but it punched through his right thigh, pinning him to the stone floor.
"GAAAHHHH!"
Ariel’s scream echoed through the church. The pain was absolute. It felt like molten lead was being poured into his leg.
Issei: "ARIEL!"
Issei turned around, horrified. He saw his friend pinned to the ground, blood pooling rapidly around his leg.
Freed: "Distracted!"
Freed lunged, slashing Issei across the back. Issei fell, the Boosted Gear flickering.
Raynare: "Now for the prize."
While Ariel was pinned and Issei was down, Raynare descended. She landed on the altar. She grabbed Asia by the hair.
Raynare: "The ritual was interrupted... but I don't need the circle to take what's mine."
She plunged her hand directly into Asia’s chest.
Asia screamed—a high, thin sound that broke Issei’s heart.
Raynare ripped the Twilight Healing (a pair of green rings) out of Asia’s soul.
Asia slumped forward, her eyes rolling back. The light left her body.
Raynare: (Holding the rings, laughing) "Finally! I have it! I can be restored!"
4. The Crimson Destruction
Issei crawled toward the altar. "Asia... Ariel..."
Ariel was conscious, but barely. He reached out, grabbing Issei's ankle.
Ariel: (Whispering) "She's... not... dead... yet. Get... help."
Freed raised his sword to finish Issei off. "Game over, pervert!"
Suddenly, the church doors didn't just open. They disintegrated.
A blast of crimson and black energy—Power of Destruction—annihilated the entire front wall of the church.
Freed: "Holy sh—!"
The dust cleared.
Rias Gremory walked in. Her eyes were glowing a lethal, furious red. Her hair floated around her as if underwater. Behind her stood Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko.
Rias: "You touched my servant. And you hurt his friends."
The pressure in the room multiplied by ten. This wasn't the pressure of a Fallen Angel. This was the pressure of a Devil King's Heir.
Raynare: (Freezing) "Gremory! Why are you here?!"
Rias: "Akeno. Kiba. Koneko. Clear the trash. Leave the crow to Issei."
5. The Rescue
Kiba moved. Freed tried to block, but Kiba was faster than sound.
Flash.
Freed’s sword shattered. Kiba kicked him into the wall. Freed, realizing he was outmatched, threw a smoke bomb and fled through a secret passage like the coward he was.
Rias walked over to Ariel. She looked at the spear pinning his leg.
She knelt, her expression softening from rage to concern.
Rias: "You are a foolish human. Brave, but foolish."
Ariel: (Gritting his teeth) "Is... Asia...?"
Rias: "She is dying. The extraction was crude."
Rias placed her hand on the light spear. Her destruction power ate the light, dissolving the weapon.
Ariel gasped as the pressure released, fresh blood flowing.
Rias: "Koneko, apply pressure. Issei... can you stand?"
Issei stood up, tears streaming down his face, his Gauntlet glowing brighter than ever before.
Issei: "She took it. She hurt them."
Rias: "Then take it back. Show me why I chose you."
6. The Conclusion (Canonical Flow)
Issei charged Raynare. Fueled by the sight of Ariel’s injury and Asia’s body, he unlocked his first real explosion of power (Dragon Shot equivalent), blasting Raynare out of the church and into the sky (where she would eventually be eliminated by Rias/Issei later).
But the focus remained on the altar.
Rias walked to Asia.
Rias: "Her life force is gone. She cannot live as a human anymore."
She looked at Issei, then at Ariel (who was being treated by Koneko).
Rias: "But I can give her a new life. If you wish it."
Issei nodded frantically. "Please! Save her!"
Ariel, fighting unconsciousness, watched as Rias produced a Bishop Piece.
He saw the ritual. He saw Asia take a breath.
She's safe, Ariel thought. Issei is safe.
I got stabbed. I got cut. I'm useless.
But as his vision faded, he heard Koneko's voice. Soft. Unusual.
Koneko: "You held the line. Good job."
Ariel smiled.
Then he passed out.
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Severely Injured (Thigh puncture, Shoulder laceration). PHY training will be halted for recovery. Mental Resilience leveled up significantly.
 * Issei: Defeated a Fallen Angel (with help). Motivation to get stronger is now solidified.
 * Asia: Reincarnated as a Bishop.
 * Rias: Now views Ariel not just as a witness, but as an Ally who bled for her peerage.

## 📕 Chapter 8: The Hospital Bed and the Devil's Truth
Timeline: Friday Morning (The day after the Church Battle).
Location: Hyoudou Residence – Guest Room (converted to a recovery room).
1. The Awakening
Ariel woke up to the smell of miso soup and antiseptic.
He tried to move. His left shoulder felt stiff, and his right thigh felt like it was on fire.
"Ow."
"He's awake!"
A weight slammed into the side of the bed. It was Issei. He had bandages on his face and knuckles, but he looked energetic.
Issei: "Dude! You scared the crap out of us! You slept for twelve hours!"
Ariel blinked, his vision clearing. He saw the ceiling. Not a hospital. A house.
Ariel: "Issei? Where... are we? Did we win?"
Issei: "My house. Rias-buchou said the hospital asks too many questions about... light spear wounds. And yeah. We won."
A soft, timid voice came from the other side of the bed.
Asia: "Good morning, Ariel-san."
Ariel turned his head. Asia Argento was standing there, alive. She was wearing a Kuoh Academy uniform that was slightly too big for her.
But Ariel’s MND caught the detail immediately.
Her aura changed. It’s not golden anymore. It feels... like Issei’s. Like Rias’s.
Ariel: "Asia. You're alive."
Asia teared up, bowing deeply. "Because of you and Issei-san. Rias-buchou... she gave me a new life."
2. The Entrance of the King (Harem Dynamic)
The door opened. Rias Gremory walked in, radiating authority and elegance. Behind her were Akeno, Koneko, and Kiba.
The room’s energy shifted instantly. Rias walked straight to Issei, placing a possessive hand on his shoulder.
Rias: "Issei, give him some space. He needs oxygen."
Issei rubbed the back of his neck, blushing. "Right, sorry Buchou! I'm just glad he's not dead."
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
Look at that body language. She’s touching Issei. She’s claiming him. Issei is the center of this solar system. I’m just a satellite.
Good. That means I did my job. The Protagonist is safe.
Ariel tried to sit up. Akeno stepped forward, fluffing his pillow with a teasing smile.
Akeno: "Ara ara, don't strain yourself, Hero-kun. You lost a lot of blood."
Koneko stood at the foot of the bed. She was eating a energy bar. She looked at Ariel, then gave a small, sharp nod.
Koneko: "You took a spear. That was... acceptable."
Ariel: "Thanks, I think."
3. The Interrogation (Veritas)
Rias pulled a chair over and sat next to Ariel. The atmosphere turned serious.
Rias: "Ariel Caelum Veritas. We need to talk. I healed your wounds, but the Light energy leaves scars that magic can't erase instantly. You'll be limping for a week."
Ariel: "I figured. So... are you going to explain why my friend has a metal claw and you shoot red lightning? Or are you going to wipe my memory again?"
Rias smiled faintly. "No more memory wipes. You’ve earned the truth."
She pulled out a small box and opened it. Inside were red chess pieces.
Rias: "I am Rias Gremory. I am a Devil. Issei is my Pawn. Asia is my Bishop. We are the Occult Research Club, but in reality, we are my Peerage."
Ariel listened, his face stoic. He didn't know the plot, so this was all new intel.
Ariel: "Devils. Chess pieces. Okay. And the bird-lady?"
Rias: "A Fallen Angel. They are our enemies. They target humans with potential, like Issei."
Rias leaned in, her eyes locking onto Ariel’s.
Rias: "But here is what I don't understand, Ariel. Issei has a Sacred Gear—the Boosted Gear. That explains his power. But you... I scanned you while you were unconscious. You are 100% Human. No Gear. No Magic. No Lineage."
The room went quiet. Kiba and Koneko leaned in, listening.
Rias: "How did you know Raynare was attacking from above? You couldn't see her. You couldn't hear her. Yet you tackled Asia a split-second before the spear was thrown."
4. The Explanation (The Seed of Haki)
Ariel looked at his hands. He decided to use Veritas.
Ariel: "I don't know."
Rias: "You don't know?"
Ariel: "It wasn't magic. It was just... a feeling. Like a radio signal screaming in my head. I felt her Intent. It felt sharp. Cold. And it felt like it was coming from the right."
Kiba’s eyes widened. "Intent Sensing? Without magic?"
Ariel: "I've been training for it. Me and Issei. We call it the 'Gut Check.' I guess... I just trusted my gut more than my eyes."
Rias sat back, looking baffled. To a Devil, sensing power is natural. But sensing intent without magic? That was a warrior's skill, usually reserved for veterans of the Great War, not a high school student.
Rias: "Potential," she murmured. "You have high sensory potential. It's raw, unrefined, and dangerous... but it saved Asia."
She stood up.
Rias: "Ariel. You are not a Devil. You are not my servant. But you fought for my Peerage. You protected my Pawn and my Bishop. For that, the House of Gremory owes you a debt."
Ariel: "I don't want money."
Rias: "I know. Issei told me you want to be 'Strong.' If you wish... you may use the Old School Building gym. You may observe our training. Perhaps... we can help you refine that 'Gut Check' of yours."
Ariel’s heart pounded. Access to supernatural training? Without selling his soul?
Ariel: "I'd like that. Thank you, Kaichou."
5. The Perverted Trio (Restored)
Rias and the girls left to let the boys talk. Issei stayed behind.
The tension evaporated. Issei slumped into the chair.
Issei: "Man... she's so cool. Did you see how she commanded the room?"
Ariel: (Chuckling, wincing at the pain) "Yeah. She's a Queen, Issei. Literally."
Issei: "And Asia! She's a Devil now! She's gonna live with me! In my house!"
Ariel: "Don't get weird, Issei. She's traumatized. Treat her like a sister, not a target."
Issei: "I know, I know! But still... it's like a dream."
Issei looked at Ariel seriously.
Issei: "Hey. Thanks. For the plan. For the flour bombs. For taking the spear. If you weren't there... I would have died in that church."
Ariel: "And if you didn't punch Freed, I'd have been sliced in half. We're even."
Ariel looked out the window. He saw the sky. He remembered his goal.
Ariel: "Issei. We survived. But we barely scraped by. Raynare was just one soldier. Rias said there's a whole war out there."
Issei: "Yeah. I need to get stronger. I need to master this Gauntlet thing."
Ariel: "And I need to figure out how to stop a spear without getting a hole in my leg."
Ariel clenched his fist.
Ariel: "The 'Gut Check' worked. But my body was too slow. Next time, Issei... I'm not just going to sense the attack. I'm going to catch it."
📈 Status Update

## 📕 Chapter 9: The Bio-Feedback and the Knight's Question
Timeline: Saturday (Recovery Day 2).
Location: Hyoudou Residence – Guest Room.
1. The Internal Hospital (Bio-Feedback Training)
The house was noisy. Downstairs, Issei was screaming because he walked in on Rias, and Asia was apologizing for existing.
Ariel lay in the guest bed, staring at the ceiling. His leg was throbbing with a dull, heavy ache.
Ariel: "System. Status report on the femur."
> Observer: "Tissue damage: Moderate. Bone fracture: Hairline. Estimated natural recovery: 6 Weeks. Current Mobility: 10%."
> 
"Six weeks is too long," Ariel muttered. "Raynare was just a scout. If a war is coming, I can't be on crutches."
He closed his eyes. He didn't enter a VR battlefield. He entered the Biological Interface.
He visualized his own body—a wireframe mesh of nerves, blood vessels, and muscle fibers.
Ariel: "Initiate Life Return (Seimei Kikan) Protocol. Level 1: Bio-Feedback."
He focused on his breathing. Inhale. Hold. Compress.
He imagined his blood flow diverting from non-essential areas (digestion, skin surface) and concentrating entirely on the wound site. He visualized the platelets as tiny workers, commanding them with his Will (SPR).
Knit. Close. Harden.
It wasn't magic. It was absolute somatic control. He forced his metabolism to burn his fat reserves to fuel rapid cell division.
His body temperature spiked. Sweat poured off him. The itch of rapid healing began to replace the pain of the injury.
[System Update: Recovery Rate increased by 300%. Estimated time: 10 Days.]
"Better," Ariel panted, wiping sweat from his forehead. "But it makes me hungry as hell."
2. The Ghost in the Room (Observation Training)
Since he couldn't move, Ariel decided to refine his MND.
He put on a sleeping mask, plunging himself into darkness.
Ariel: "Okay. The 'Gut Check' saved me from the spear. But it was clumsy. I need to see without seeing."
He expanded his senses. He tried to ignore the sounds (Issei yelling) and feel the presence.
 * Signature 1: A roaring fire downstairs. Chaotic, warm, fluctuating wildly.
   * That's Issei. He's a furnace of emotion.
 * Signature 2: A dense, crimson weight. Regal. Heavy.
   * Rias. She feels like gravity.
 * Signature 3: A soft, flickering green light. Gentle.
   * Asia. She feels like a healing salve.
Then, he felt a fourth signature approaching his door.
It was sharp. Cold. Metallic. Like a razor blade moving through silk.
It wasn't hostile, but it was Edge.
Knock. Knock.
Ariel pulled up his sleeping mask.
"Come in, Kiba."
3. The Knight's Visit
Kiba Yuuto opened the door. He was carrying a basket of fruit and a get-well card. He looked surprised.
"You knew it was me?"
Ariel smiled weakly. "You feel sharp, Yuuto-kun. Like a sword that's eager to cut."
Kiba paused, his polite smile faltering for a second. He walked in and set the basket down.
" sharp... huh? That's an interesting way to describe a friend."
Kiba pulled up a chair. He looked at Ariel's bandaged leg.
"I wanted to thank you properly. For the strategy. For the flashlights. And for saving Asia. Issei is the Pawn, but you... you were the player."
"I was just the guy with the shopping list," Ariel deflected. "Issei did the punching. You did the slicing. I just made sure you didn't slip on the floor."
Kiba laughed, a genuine, boyish sound. "The lubricant trap. Freed was furious. I've never seen an Exorcist fall like that."
4. The Theory of Intent (Mental Bonding)
The laughter died down. Kiba leaned forward, his expression serious.
"But seriously, Ariel. Rias told us. You have no magic. No Sacred Gear. Yet you tackled Asia before Raynare threw the spear. How?"
Ariel looked at Kiba. He saw the hunger in the Knight's eyes. Kiba wasn't asking out of curiosity; he was asking because he needed to know.
Ariel: "You're a swordsman, Kiba. Have you ever fought someone and known they were going to swing before they moved their muscle?"
Kiba: "Sometimes. High-level masters... they radiate 'Killing Intent' (Sakki)."
Ariel: "Exactly. But 'Killing Intent' is loud. It's a scream. I'm trying to hear the 'Whispers.' Even when someone isn't trying to kill you... they project their will. If they want to walk left, their spirit moves left a micro-second before their body does."
Ariel tapped his own temple.
"I don't watch the sword. I watch the Will. If I can sense where the Will is going, the sword is just an afterthought."
Kiba’s eyes widened. He looked at his own hands.
"To cut the intent... not the steel. That sounds... like the ultimate form of swordsmanship."
Ariel: "It is. In the stories I read... the masters of this technique can't be touched. They flow like water around a stone."
Kiba stood up, energized. "Intent Sensing. I need to train that. My speed is my weapon, but if I run into a trap... speed means nothing."
Ariel: "When I can walk... I'll show you the drills. We can blindfold each other and throw tennis balls. It's humiliating, but it works."
Kiba smiled, extending a fist.
"I look forward to it, Ariel. Get well soon. The club isn't the same without the Strategist."
Ariel bumped fists with the Devil.
"I'll be back before you know it. Just... keep Issei out of trouble."
5. The Hunger (Recovery Cost)
Kiba left. Ariel slumped back into the pillows.
The Bio-Feedback session had drained his glucose levels. His stomach roared.
"Issei!" Ariel shouted. "Issei! I need calories! Bring me the fruit basket! And a steak! And maybe a pizza!"
Downstairs, Issei yelled back. "Dude, you're an invalid, not a starving beast!"
"I'm healing! My mitochondria need fuel!"
Ariel grabbed an apple from Kiba's basket and bit into it savagely.
Eat. Digest. Convert to Energy. Heal.
He closed his eyes again, activating the PTD.
"System. While I digest... load the Observation Archive. I want to study Katakuri's Future Sight. If I'm going to be a target, I need to see further ahead than just 'Danger'."
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Healing accelerated (10 Days remaining). Relationship with Kiba: Established (Martial Arts Bond). Skill: "Presence Sensing" improving.
 * Issei: Living the harem life, but training his Boosted Gear in secret (motivated by Ariel's sacrifice).
 * The Plot: The Riser Phenex arc is approaching. Grayfia will arrive soon.

## 📕 Chapter 10: The chessboard and the Limp
Timeline: Monday Morning (10 Days Post-Injury).
Location: Kuoh Academy Gates.
1. The New Status Quo
Ariel walked through the school gates. He wasn't using crutches, but he had a slight, noticeable limp in his right leg—a lingering reminder of the light spear. He carried his bag over his good shoulder.
The atmosphere in the school had shifted tectonically.
 * Asia Argento: She was walking beside Issei, beaming. Every guy who looked at her blushed. She was the new "Idol."
 * Issei Hyoudou: He was public enemy number one. The Kendo Club guys were glaring daggers at him.
   * Random Student: "How did the Beast get the Beauty? It's a crime against nature!"
 * Ariel: He was... invisible again. Or so he thought.
Issei: "Man, the stare-down is intense today. They want my blood."
Ariel: "They're jealous, Issei. Just don't grin like an idiot, and they might not lynch you."
2. The Checkmate (Sona Sitri)
As they changed shoes at the lockers, the crowd parted.
Sona Sitri, the Student Council President, walked up to them. Her Vice-President, Tsubaki Shinra, stood silently behind her.
Issei froze. Sona was terrifying in a different way than Rias. She was pure Order.
Sona: "Hyoudou Issei. Asia Argento. Welcome to Kuoh. Please ensure your transfer paperwork is filed by noon."
Issei: "Y-yes, Kaichou!"
Sona’s eyes slid over to Ariel. She pushed up her glasses.
Sona: "And Ariel Veritas. You were absent for a week. 'Family emergency,' according to the report."
Ariel: "Something like that."
Sona looked at his leg. She looked at his shoulder (hidden by the uniform).
Sona: "Walk with me, Veritas-kun. We need to discuss your attendance record."
It wasn't a request.
Ariel sighed. "Go ahead, Issei. I'm getting grilled."
3. The Student Council Room (Veritas)
The door clicked shut. Sona sat behind her desk. The room was perfectly organized.
Sona: "Drop the act. My familiar saw the explosion at the church."
Ariel didn't flinch. He leaned against the wall to ease the weight on his bad leg.
Ariel: "I figured. You're too sharp to miss a fireworks display."
Sona: "Rias cleaned up the mess. She claimed a new Bishop. But the report mentioned a human accomplice who engaged a Fallen Angel using... 'Improvised Munitions'."
Sona leaned forward.
Sona: "You are dangerous, Ariel. Not because you have power, but because you have none, yet you intervene in affairs that kill normal men. Why?"
Ariel met her gaze. Veritas.
Ariel: "Because they hurt my friend. And because I hate it when powerful people think they can use weak people as spare parts."
Sona studied him. She saw no deception. She saw a logic that mirrored her own—Order through Action.
Sona: "You hate bullies."
Ariel: "I despise them."
Sona: "Then we have common ground. I tolerate Rias's chaos because she is family. But I value stability. If you ever feel that Rias's... passion is putting the school at risk, come to me. The Student Council is always looking for capable strategists."
Ariel: "Is that a recruitment offer?"
Sona: "It's an option. Don't die playing hero, Veritas. It causes paperwork."
Ariel smirked. "I'll try to keep the explosions to a minimum."
Result: Son a Sitri acknowledges Ariel. He is now on the radar of both major Devil factions in the school.

## 📕 Chapter 11: The Forest of Monsters and the Eyes of the Weak
Timeline: Saturday (Familiar Day).
Location: The Familiar Forest (Underworld Territory).
1. The Excursion
The Occult Research Club gathered. It was time for Issei and Asia to get Familiars.
Rias: "Ariel-kun, you're coming too."
Ariel: "Me? I'm human. Can I even bind a familiar?"
Akeno: "Ara ara, of course! Familiars respond to compatibility. And since you're our 'Tactician,' you need a partner."
They teleported to the forest. They were greeted by Zatouji, the Familiar Master (the Ash Ketchum of DxD).
Zatouji: "Yo! Fresh meat! Looking for dragons? Slimes? Harpies?"
Issei: "SLIMES! I want a slime that dissolves clothes!"
Asia: "I... I would like something cute. Like a sprite?"
Ariel stood back, observing the forest. His MND was buzzing.
This place is thick with intent. Every bush has eyes.
2. The Hunt (Observation Training)
While Issei chased slimes and got beat up, Ariel wandered off the main path.
He wasn't looking for power. He was looking for Utility.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
I have no magic. I have no ranged attacks. My 'Observation' is my only real weapon, but it's short-range. I need a spotter. I need eyes in the back of my head.
He closed his eyes. He tried to sense the forest.
Don't look for the loud monsters. Look for the quiet ones.
He felt a ping.
A sharp, curious gaze. Not hostile. Just... watching.
Ariel walked toward a dense thicket of Spirit Bamboo.
Sitting on a branch was a small creature.
It looked like a Lemur, but it had four ears and its fur shifted colors, blending perfectly with the bark. Its eyes were large, intelligent, and glowing faint violet.
Zatouji appeared behind Ariel.
Zatouji: "Oho! A Void-Echo Lemur? Rare find, kid. They're useless in a fight, though. They don't bite, they don't scratch. They just run and hide. We usually sell them as pets."
Ariel: "They hide? How?"
Zatouji: "They sense killing intent from a mile away. Impossible to catch. If you want to catch it, you have to have zero intent."
Ariel smiled. Zero intent. That's the training.
3. The Taming (The Blank Mind)
Ariel looked at the Lemur. The Lemur looked at him.
If Ariel tried to grab it, the Lemur would vanish.
Ariel took a deep breath. Bio-Feedback.
Lower the heart rate. Clear the mind. I am not a hunter. I am a tree.
He used his PTD training to suppress his "Projection." He pulled his aura inward. He became a void in the forest.
He walked forward. Slowly. Limping slightly.
The Lemur tilted its head. It didn't sense a predator. It sensed... nothing. Just a moving object.
Ariel reached into his pocket and pulled out a simple energy bar (chocolate). He unwrapped it slowly.
He didn't offer it. He just ate a piece and held the rest out, not looking at the Lemur.
I don't care if you come. I am just a rock eating chocolate.
The Lemur sniffed. Curiosity overcame fear. It hopped down. It crept closer.
It sensed no trap. No net. No magic.
It grabbed the chocolate from Ariel’s hand.
Ariel didn't grab back. He just waited.
The Lemur ate the chocolate, then scrambled up Ariel’s arm and sat on his shoulder, wrapping its tail around his neck. It purred—a sound that vibrated against Ariel's spine.
Zatouji: "Well, I'll be damned. You bored it into submission."
Ariel: "We have an understanding. I feed him; he watches my back."
Ariel looked at the Lemur. "I'll call you Echo."
4. The Comparison
They regrouped.
 * Issei: Had failed to catch a slime (too perverted) and ended up with a specialized Dragon Sprite (Ryuu) that looked like a mini-dragon.
 * Asia: Found a Rassei (Sprite Dragon) that was adorable.
 * Ariel: Had a four-eared Lemur sleeping on his head.
Rias: "A Lemur? It's... cute. But does it do anything?"
Ariel grinned. "Echo, check the perimeter."
The Lemur’s ears twitched. It chattered softly, pointing a small finger toward the north bushes.
Two seconds later, a wild boar burst from that exact spot.
Koneko punched the boar out cold.
Ariel: "He hears intent. He's a radar. With him, my Observation range just tripled."
Rias smiled. "A tactical choice. Very you, Ariel."
5. The Return
As they walked back to the teleport circle, Issei bumped Ariel’s shoulder.
Issei: "Dude, you got a monkey that predicts the future. That's kinda cool."
Ariel: "And you got a mini-dragon. We're moving up in the world, Issei."
Ariel stroked Echo’s fur.
I have a warning system now. Next time Raynare shows up... I won't be surprised.
[System Update: Familiar Acquired (Echo). Passive Perk: +20% Perception Range.]
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Acquired Echo (Support Familiar). Status: Recovering.
 * Issei: Acquired Familiar.
 * Plot: The daily life arc is stabilizing. The Riser Phenex arc is the next major event.

## 📕 Chapter 12: The Synapse and The Silence
Timeline: The Week leading up to the Rating Game announcement.
Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
1. The Two-Brain Problem
Ariel sat in the center of his living room, legs crossed in a lotus position. His leg brace was off; the healing was 90% complete thanks to the Bio-Feedback regimen.
Sitting on top of his head was Echo, the Void-Echo Lemur.
Ariel: "Okay, Echo. The problem is latency. You hear the intent, you chirp, I hear the chirp, I move. That takes 0.5 seconds. In a fight against light spears, that’s too slow."
Echo titled his head, letting out a soft mrrp.
Ariel: "We need to share the signal. I need to feel what you feel."
He activated the PTD.
> Observer: "External Neural Link Detected (Familiar Bond). Attempting synchronization?"
> 
Ariel hesitated. Bringing a magical creature into his mental palace was risky. But Echo was part of his soul now.
"Authorize."
2. The Stereo Vision (PTD Training)
The room dissolved into the white grid. Echo looked around, eyes wide, chattering excitedly at the floating text boxes. He wasn't scared; he was a creature of the Void, and the PTD felt like home.
Scenario: The Blindfire Gauntlet.
Threat: Random projectiles from 360 degrees.
Condition: Ariel is blindfolded.
Ariel stood in the dark.
Whizz. A rock flew from behind.
Echo’s tail twitched against Ariel’s neck—a physical signal.
Ariel ducked. The rock missed.
Whizz. Whizz.
Tail tap left. Ear twitch right.
Ariel moved. Left. Right.
It wasn't telepathy. It was haptic feedback. Echo became a sensory organ. Ariel stopped thinking "The monkey touched me" and started treating the tail on his neck like an extra set of eyes.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
My range is expanding. Before, I could only sense what was in front of me. With Echo, I have a sphere of awareness. It’s clumsy... but it’s working.
By the end of the week, Ariel wasn't dodging rocks. He was dodging paintballs fired at high velocity. He ended the sessions covered in welts, but he was smiling.
[System Update: Observation Haki (Synchronized) - Level 1. Perception Range: 360 degrees (10 meters).]

## 📕 Chapter 13: The Silver Maid and The Arrogant Fire
Timeline: Monday Afternoon.
Location: Occult Research Clubroom.
1. The Calm Before the Storm
Ariel walked into the clubroom with Issei and Asia. He walked without a limp for the first time in weeks. Echo was hiding in his school bag, sleeping (he was shy around crowds).
Rias: "Welcome, everyone. Today, we have..."
The air pressure in the room dropped. It became cold, sterile, and terrifyingly heavy.
A magic circle appeared—silver and geometric.
A woman stepped out. She wore a maid outfit, but she carried herself like an empress.
Grayfia Lucifuge. The Strongest Queen.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
MND Alert: Threat Level - EXTREME. Do not engage. Do not breathe wrong.
This isn't like Raynare. This woman could kill everyone in this room by blinking.
Ariel stepped back, putting himself near the wall, trying to be "The Background Character." Issei, however, was sweating bullets.
Issei: "Who... is that?"
Rias: "Grayfia. My brother's Queen. And a messenger."
Grayfia bowed, but her eyes were cold.
Grayfia: "Lady Rias. Lord Sirzechs inquires why you have not returned home. The engagement ceremony is approaching."
Rias: "I told you, Grayfia. I am not marrying him."
Grayfia: "Your personal feelings are irrelevant to the Phenex family. Speaking of which..."
2. The Intruder
A second magic circle appeared. This one was violent, roaring with orange flames.
Riser Phenex emerged.
He didn't walk; he strutted. He wore a white suit that cost more than Ariel's entire life earnings. Behind him, fifteen beautiful women materialized—his harem.
Riser: "Rias! My beloved! I came to fetch you from this pigsty of a school!"
Issei: "Pigsty?!"
Riser looked at Issei. Then at Ariel.
Riser: "Oh? You keep pets? A Dragon-trash and... a nothing? Why is there a human breathing my air?"
Ariel stayed silent. He was observing.
Check the aura. It's hot. Arrogant. Unstable.
Echo is shivering in the bag. This guy radiates 'Bully'.
3. The Provocation
Riser snapped his fingers. His Queen, Yubelluna, stepped forward.
Riser grabbed her waist, pulling her close. He kissed her roughly, then slid his hand down to grope her breast, staring Rias in the eyes.
Riser: "See this, Rias? This is what a real Devil nobility looks like. Absolute obedience. You and your peerage are playing house. I am a King."
Issei snapped.
Issei: "GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!"
[BOOST!]
The Red Gauntlet manifested. Issei charged.
Riser: "Pathetic."
Riser didn't even move. His Rook stepped forward and backhanded Issei.
SMACK.
Issei flew across the room, crashing into the wall.
Rias: "Issei!"
Riser: "Know your place, Pawn. I am Riser Phenex. I am Immortal. I am Fire."
Riser raised his hand. A ball of Hellfire formed. It wasn't normal fire; it was condensed magical plasma.
Riser: "I think I'll burn the trash. Starting with the one in the corner who thinks he's hiding."
He looked at Ariel.
4. The Intervention (Remastered)
Riser flicked his wrist. The fireball launched at Ariel.
It was fast. It was lethal.
Rias: "ARIEL! DODGE!"
Ariel didn't dodge.
Echo screeched in his mind: [IMPACT. CHEST. 0.8 SECONDS.]
Ariel saw the trajectory.
If I dodge, it hits the bookshelf with the occult texts. Rias likes those books.
If I run, he wins.
Ariel stepped forward.
He took a breath. Bio-Feedback.
Lock the core. Tighten the pectoral muscles. Flood the arms with blood.
[Technique: Iron Body (Tekkai) - Imperfect]
He swung his right arm in a backhand motion, aiming not at the fire, but through it.
He imagined his arm was a steel bar. He poured his Veritas into the strike—the absolute refusal to be bullied.
SMASH.
His forearm connected with the fireball.
Magical fire met condensed muscle and stubborn Will.
The fireball shattered. It dispersed into embers that rained harmlessly on the floor.
Ariel stood there. His school uniform sleeve was burned off. His arm was smoking, the skin red and blistered, but unbroken.
The room went dead silent.
Riser stared. "You... you hit my fire?"
Ariel patted the embers off his shoulder. He winced—it hurt like hell—but he didn't show it.
Ariel: "You're ruining the books."
He looked Riser in the eye. He didn't have a cool anime line this time. He had honesty.
Ariel: "And you treat your girls like objects. It's gross. Put a shirt on, you look desperate."
Issei: (From the floor) "Dude..."
Rias: (Staring at Ariel's arm) He didn't use magic. He just... refused to burn.
5. The Challenge
Riser’s face turned purple. "You... INSOLENT MONKEY!"
He flared his aura. The entire room began to heat up.
Grayfia: "Enough."
Grayfia stepped between them. Her aura crushed Riser's instantly. The ice in her voice dropped the temperature by 20 degrees.
Grayfia: "Lord Riser. You are a guest. Attacking civilians is a violation of the treaty."
She looked at Issei, then at Ariel.
Grayfia: "However... the Gremory Pawn has challenged you. And this human... has insulted you."
Riser: "I demand satisfaction! A Rating Game! I will crush them all!"
Rias: "I accept."
Riser sneered at Ariel.
Riser: "And you, human. You think you're tough? I'll allow you to watch. I want you to see exactly what happens to trash that tries to be iron."
Ariel held his burned arm. He grinned.
Ariel: "I'll be there. Just try not to trip over your ego."
Riser vanished in a circle of fire. Grayfia nodded to Rias and followed.
The silence returned.
Koneko walked up to Ariel. She touched his burned arm.
Koneko: "You're an idiot."
Ariel: "Yeah."
Koneko: "But that was cool."
Rias walked over. She touched the burn, healing it with a soft red light.
Rias: "Ariel. Why?"
Ariel: "Because he pissed me off. And because Issei couldn't take another hit."
Rias looked at his healed arm.
Rias: "We have ten days. We are going to the mountains. You are coming with us."
Ariel: "I'm not a Devil, Rias."
Rias: "No. You're something else. And I need whatever that was on my team."
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Took a fireball. PHY validated (Iron Body works on magic, barely). Gained respect of the Peerage. Invited to Training Camp.
 * Issei: Humiliated by Riser. Motivation to train is at Maximum.
 * Plot: The Rating Game is set. The Training Camp begins.

## 📕 Chapter 13 (Revised): The Harem King and The Iron Wall
Timeline: Monday Afternoon.
Location: Occult Research Clubroom.
1. The Silver Messenger
Ariel stood near the back wall, Echo sleeping in his bag. He watched as the silver magic circle manifested.
Grayfia Lucifuge appeared. The temperature dropped ten degrees.
Rias: "Grayfia. I told you I’m not going back."
Grayfia: "Lord Sirzechs is insistent. The engagement is binding."
Ariel observed Grayfia.
Internal Monologue:
She feels like a glacier. Absolute, frozen power. If she wanted us dead, we’d be dead before we saw her move.
2. The Golden Fire (Riser’s Arrival)
A second circle exploded into existence—violent, orange fire.
Riser Phenex emerged, flanked by his fifteen peerage members. He looked around the old school building with a sneer.
Riser: "So this is where you play house, Rias? It smells like mold and poverty."
Issei: "Hey! Watch your mouth, chicken-guy!"
Riser glanced at Issei. Then he looked at the girls behind him—Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Asia.
Riser: "A Low-Class Pawn speaking out of turn? And you surround yourself with women... don't tell me you have ambitions, boy?"
Issei: "Damn right I do! I'm going to be the Harem King!"
Ariel sighed. He said it. He actually said it out loud in front of an Ultimate-Class Devil.
3. The Mockery (The Canonical Trigger)
Riser laughed. It was a cruel, pitying sound.
Riser: "A Harem King? You? A reincarnated human with a rusted gear?"
Riser shook his head. He turned to his own peerage.
Riser: "You want to see a harem, boy? This is a harem."
He snapped his fingers. Yubelluna (his Queen) stepped forward, obedient and submissive.
Riser grabbed her by the back of the neck. He didn't hold her like a lover; he held her like a trophy. He pulled her face to his and kissed her—deep, wet, and aggressive. It wasn't romantic. It was a display of ownership.
He broke the kiss, a string of saliva connecting them, and then slid his hand down to grope her breast, squeezing hard enough to make Yubelluna wince slightly, though she kept smiling.
Riser: "Do you see, Pawn? They are mine. Body and soul. They live to serve me. They die for me. That is the privilege of the Phenex. You will never be on my level."
4. The Shift (Jealousy to Rage)
Issei stared. Initially, Ariel saw the flash of Envy in Issei's eyes—the desire for that kind of attention.
But as Riser continued to grope Yubelluna like she was an object, Issei’s expression shifted. The envy curdled into Rage.
Issei: "You... you treat her like a toy."
Riser: "She is a toy. They all are."
Issei’s gauntlet flashed green.
Issei: "THAT'S NOT A HAREM! THAT'S SLAVERY, YOU BASTARD!"
[BOOST!]
Issei charged. He didn't have a plan. He just wanted to smash Riser’s face.
Riser: "Mira."
Riser’s Rook, a tall woman with a staff, stepped in. She swung her weapon.
CRACK.
Issei took the hit to the ribs. He was sent flying across the room, crashing into the sofa and overturning the tea table.
Asia: "Issei-san!"
5. The Intervention (Ariel’s Turn)
Riser looked bored. He lit a small ball of Hellfire in his hand, tossing it up and down.
Riser: "Disappointing. Rias, your servants are unruly. And what about this one?"
Riser looked at the corner. At Ariel.
Ariel was leaning against the wall. He wasn't looking at Riser with fear. He was looking at him with Disgust.
Riser: "You. Human. You've been staring at my Queen. You want her?"
Ariel pushed off the wall. He walked forward, limping slightly.
Ariel: "She's beautiful. Yeah, I stared. I'm a guy."
Rias tensed. Ariel, don't provoke him.
Ariel: "But watching you touch her... it made me sick. You make 'Harem King' sound like a job for a scumbag."
Riser’s eyes narrowed. "Insolence."
Riser: "Burn."
He flicked the fireball at Ariel. It wasn't a warning shot. It was aimed at Ariel’s face. The heat was intense enough to curl the pages of the books on the shelf.
Issei: "ARIEL! MOVE!"
Ariel didn't move.
Echo’s tail slapped his neck: [IMPACT. FACE. 0.5 SECONDS.]
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
No dodging. If I dodge, he thinks I'm scared. If I'm scared, I'm a background character.
Be the Wall.
Ariel took a breath. Bio-Feedback.
Hardening. Core. Shoulder. Forearm.
[Technique: Iron Body (Tekkai) - Focused Defense]
He didn't backhand it this time. He punched it.
He threw a straight right cross directly into the center of the magic flame.
BOOM.
The fireball exploded against his fist.
The magic tried to burn him. The heat was agonizing. It felt like sticking his hand in a deep fryer.
But his Will (Veritas) refused to let the fire pass his knuckles. He forced his muscles to be denser than the flame.
The fire scattered, dying out.
Ariel stood there, his fist smoking, his knuckles blackened and bleeding, his sleeve incinerated up to the elbow.
Ariel: "Is that it? I thought Phoenix fire was supposed to be hot."
6. The Declaration
The silence in the room was absolute.
Yubelluna stared at the human who had punched fire.
Riser’s arrogance cracked for the first time.
Riser: "You... blocked it?"
Ariel: "I didn't block it. I broke it."
Ariel lowered his hand, hiding the tremor of pain. He looked at Issei, who was pulling himself out of the debris.
Ariel: "Issei. Get up."
Issei groaned, standing up, his eyes burning with renewed fire.
Issei: "Yeah. I'm up."
Ariel: "He insulted your dream. He insulted Rias. And he burned my favorite shirt."
Ariel turned back to Riser.
Ariel: "We challenge you. Not a brawl. A Rating Game. If Issei wins, you leave Rias alone. And you apologize to your Queen for treating her like garbage."
Riser laughed. It was a loud, forced laugh to cover his confusion.
Riser: "A Game? Against trash? Fine! I accept! Ten days! I will crush you both and burn this school to ash!"
He vanished in a pillar of fire. Grayfia bowed politely and faded away.
7. The Aftermath
The adrenaline crashed. Ariel hissed, clutching his burned hand.
Ariel: "Okay... that hurt way more than I pretended it did."
Koneko was at his side instantly. She looked at his blackened knuckles. She didn't call him an idiot this time.
She looked at his face.
Koneko: "You punched fire."
Ariel: "It seemed like the logical option."
Rias walked over. She took Ariel’s hand gently, applying healing magic. Her eyes were filled with a complex mix of gratitude and calculation.
Rias: "Ariel... you truly are the Variable. I accept the challenge. We are going to the mountains."
Issei: "We're gonna train! I'm gonna smash that guy's face in!"
Ariel looked at his healed (but scarred) hand.
I survived one fireball. But in a Rating Game, he'll throw a thousand. I need to get stronger. I need Haki.
📈 Status Update
 * Correction: Canonical jealousy/mockery flow restored.
 * Ariel: Hand injured (burns). Iron Body validated against low-level magic attacks. Reputation with Peerage skyrocketed.
 * Issei: Motivation is now strictly "Defeat Riser / Prove my Harem Dream is better."

## 📕 Chapter 12 (Expanded): The Week of Silence and Steel
Timeline: The Week leading up to Riser's Arrival (Sunday to Sunday).
Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD Interface).
Goal: Bridge the gap between PHY 0.9 (Recovering) and PHY 1.2 (Combat Capable), and unlock Iron Body.
📅 Day 1 (Sunday): The Synapse (Echo Synchronization)
Focus: Expanding Observation Range.
Ariel sat in his living room. His leg brace was off, but the muscle was still tender. Echo, the Void Lemur, sat on his head.
Ariel: "Okay, Echo. We have a latency issue. You chirp, I hear, I move. That's 0.5 seconds. I need 0.1."
He activated the PTD.
> Observer: "External Neural Link Detected. Initiating Haptic Feedback Synchronization."
> 
The Simulation:
Ariel stood in a dark void. He was blindfolded.
The PTD fired simulated rubber bullets from random angles.
 * Attempt 1: Echo chirped. Ariel dodged. Hit. (Too slow).
 * Attempt 2: Ariel focused on the physical sensation of Echo's tail on his neck.
   * Tail tap Left: Dodge Right.
   * Tail tap Right: Dodge Left.
   * Tail curl: Duck.
It wasn't telepathy; it was a tactical code. By the end of the 8-hour session, Ariel wasn't thinking; he was reacting to the tactile pressure of the familiar.
[Result: Reaction Time reduced by 0.2s. Observation Range: 360 degrees via Familiar.]
📅 Day 2 (Monday): The Weight of the World (Gravity Training)
Focus: Physical Density & Shedding the "Softness."
Ariel returned from school. He felt heavy—not physically, but mentally. The "Inferiority" was gnawing at him. He saw Issei getting stronger just by being angry. Ariel needed a multiplier.
Ariel: "System. I'm soft. My muscle density stopped the sword, but it cut deep. I need to be harder. Load the Gravity Module."
> Observer: "Warning. Leg fracture at 85% healing. High impact discouraged."
> 
Ariel: "Then we do static holds. Set Gravity to 1.5x Earth Normal."
The PTD simulated the crushing weight. Ariel collapsed to his knees. His breath was shallow. It felt like he was wearing a lead suit.
This was inspired by the Dragon Ball gravity chamber.
The Grind:
 * Plank Position: He held a plank for 60 seconds. His core screamed. The excess fat on his body felt like it was dragging him into the floor.
 * Slow Pushups: He did them agonizingly slow. Down (3 seconds). Up (3 seconds).
 * Visual: He imagined his muscle fibers tearing and rebuilding thicker, denser, like woven steel cables.
He spent the night in the crushing weight, sweating out the "Civilian" softness. When he exited the PTD, walking in normal gravity felt like floating.
[Result: PHY 0.9 \rightarrow 1.0. Core Density Increased.]
📅 Day 3 (Tuesday): The Pilot Light (Energy Sensing)
Focus: Discovering SPR (Spirit/Will).
Ariel realized that while he couldn't use Magic, he needed to feel it to nullify it. He needed to find his own "Inner Light" (Steward Demonic Emperor / Bleach inspiration).
The Meditation:
He entered the Zen Garden Module in the PTD.
Ariel: "I need to find the 'Stop' button in my soul. The thing I used on Raynare."
He sat for hours. He tried to find a "Chi" flow. He found nothing.
He tried to find "Magic." Nothing.
Then, he tried to find "Stubbornness." (Veritas).
He focused on the feeling of refusal. The feeling of saying "No."
No, I won't die. No, I won't be a background character.
Deep in his gut, he felt a flicker. A cold, grey spark. It wasn't hot like Issei’s fire. It was heavy and solid, like a stone.
Ariel: "There you are. My Presence."
He spent the night feeding that spark, expanding it from a point to a thin layer covering his skin.
[Result: SPR 0.1 \rightarrow 0.3. Inner Energy (Will) Detected.]
📅 Day 4 (Wednesday): The Tactical Ghost (MGS VR)
Focus: Stealth & CQC (Close Quarters Combat).
Ariel knew he couldn't overpower a Devil. He had to outthink them. He loaded the Metal Gear Solid VR module.
Scenario: Sneaking Mission.
Target: Infiltrate a fortress guarded by Genetically Enhanced Soldiers (Simulating low-level Devils).
Restriction: No lethal weapons.
Ariel moved through the digital corridors. He used his Echo-Sense to track patrol patterns.
 * Takedown: He waited for a guard to turn. He utilized Burst Speed (short sprint). He grabbed the guard, used a Judo throw (utilizing the enemy's weight), and applied a sleeper hold.
 * Efficiency: He learned to control his breathing to match the ambient noise (AC hum). He learned to step heel-to-toe to eliminate sound.
He failed 12 times. He was shot, stabbed, and spotted.
On the 13th try, he cleared the floor without raising an alert.
[Result: MND 1.25 \rightarrow 1.35. Stealth Mastery: Beginner.]
📅 Day 5 (Thursday): The Iron Forge (Tekkai Training)
Focus: Impact Conditioning for Iron Body.
This was the most painful day. To use Tekkai (Iron Body), the mind must override the body's desire to flinch.
Ariel: "System. Load Blunt Force Cycle. Batons. 50% Power."
The simulation generated a training dummy armed with a steel baton.
Instruction: Do not dodge. Tighten the muscle at the point of impact.
WHACK. Ribs.
WHACK. Forearm.
WHACK. Thigh.
Ariel grunted, his vision blurring.
Ariel: "Again! Harder! If I flinch, I die!"
He visualized his skin turning into the black metallic coating of One Piece Armament Haki. He poured his SPR (Will) into the muscle, commanding it to be harder than steel.
By the 100th hit, his arm didn't bruise. It thudded like hitting a tire.
[Result: PHY 1.0 \rightarrow 1.1. Skill Unlocked: Iron Body (Imperfect - 2 Second Duration).]
📅 Day 6 (Friday): The Bully Module (Social Camouflage)
Focus: Reading Social Cues & Deception.
Ariel took a break from physical pain to train his MND. He loaded the Bully (Canis Canem Edit) module.
Goal: Navigate a hostile high school environment without fighting.
He walked through digital hallways filled with aggressive NPCs. He used his Observation to read micro-expressions.
 * That guy is clenching his fist. Avoid eye contact.
 * That girl is looking for a target to mock. Project 'Boring' energy.
He learned to manipulate his own "Social Presence." He could make himself invisible (The background character) or threatening (The predator) just by shifting his posture and gaze. This was crucial for dealing with arrogant Devils like Riser.
[Result: Social Stealth Increased. Ability to toggle 'Presence' gained.]
📅 Day 7 (Saturday): The Synthesis
Focus: Rest & Integration.
Ariel didn't train. He sat on his balcony, Echo eating an apple beside him.
He reviewed his stats.
[Current Status]
 * PHY: 1.15 (Athletic, Dense).
 * MND: 1.4 (Tactical, Alert).
 * SPR: 0.35 (Awakened Will).
 * Skills: Iron Body (Lv 1), Observation (Lv 1 - Echo Sync), Stealth (Lv 1).
Ariel: "I'm not a Legend yet. But I'm not a civilian anymore."
He looked at his hand. He clenched it. The skin felt tight, tough.
"If Riser shows up... I might be able to surprise him."
📅 Sunday: The Calm
Ariel spent the day with Issei and Asia, acting normal. He reinforced his "Friendly Pervert" cover, but Issei noticed Ariel walked with a new, silent confidence.
Issei: "You seem... solid, dude."
Ariel: "Just eating my vegetables, Issei."
The week was over. The Mortal Variable was forged.
Tomorrow, Riser Phenex would arrive.

## ➕ Chapter 12 (Addendum): The Wall of Will
Timeline: Friday Night (Day 6).
Location: Ariel’s Apartment (PTD).
📅 Day 6 (Night): The Concept of "No"
Focus: Energy Resistance / Nullification Theory.
Ariel was tired from the "Bully Module," but he couldn't sleep. He kept thinking about Raynare's light spear.
Physical density (Iron Body) stops swords. But what stops light? What stops fire?
Ariel: "System. If a Logia user turns into fire, I can't punch them with just muscles. I need to touch the 'Substance' beneath the element."
He pulled up the archive of Rayleigh explaining Haki.
"Armament Haki creates an invisible armor. It can touch the substantial body of a Devil Fruit user."
Ariel: "I don't have the Spirit to make invisible armor yet. But maybe I can project the Intent."
The Simulation:
Scenario: The Steam Vent.
Threat: A continuous jet of high-pressure, scalding steam blocking a doorway.
Goal: Walk through it without burning.
Attempt 1: Ariel walked in. He tightened his muscles (Iron Body).
Result: The heat bypassed his muscles and cooked his skin. Failure.
"GAH! Hot! Physics still apply!"
Attempt 2 (The Paradigm Shift):
Ariel sat before the steam. He remembered Aizen from Bleach. Aizen didn't just block; he crushed the opponent's Reiatsu (Energy) with his own.
He remembered Shanks blocking Akainu's magma.
Ariel: "It's not about enduring the heat. It's about denying the heat's right to exist in my space."
He focused on his SPR (0.35). It was a small, grey spark.
He didn't try to coat his whole body. He pushed that spark into his right hand.
He visualized a wall. A mental command: "Nothing passes this point."
He thrust his hand into the steam.
He didn't feel the heat on his skin. He felt a pressure against his Will.
The steam parted around his hand for 0.5 seconds before his concentration broke and he got burned again.
Ariel: "I felt it. For a second... the heat didn't touch me. I pushed it away."
He spent the rest of the night trying to hold that "Rejection" for longer.
He managed to hold it for 1 second.
[System Update: Nullification Intent (Rudimentary) - Unlocked. Effect: Reduces Energy Damage by 30%.]
🧠 Why This Matters for Chapter 13
Now, when Ariel punches Riser's fireball:
 * Iron Body (PHY): Protects his bones from the impact force.
 * Nullification Intent (SPR): Disperses the magic holding the fire together.
 * The Injury: Because his Nullification is only "Rudimentary" (30% reduction), he still gets his sleeve burned off and his skin blistered.
This makes the victory tactical and earned, rather than magical.

## 📕 Chapter 14: The Mountain of Hell and the Tactician's Table
Timeline: Day 1 of Training Camp (Tuesday).
Location: Gremory Family Villa (Deep Mountains).
1. The Arrival
The Gremory "Villa" was less of a cottage and more of a fortress. It sat secluded in a mountain range owned by the Devil nobility, surrounded by dense forests and high-level barrier wards.
Ariel stepped out of the car, his bandaged hand throbbing. He carried a military-style rucksack (packed with protein bars, first aid, and tactical gear). Issei carried a bag full of porn mags and snacks. The contrast was stark.
Rias: "Welcome to hell, everyone. For the next ten days, we do not sleep. We do not rest. We prepare for war."
Issei: "Y-Yes, Buchou! ...Wait, no sleep?"
Ariel: "She means we sleep when we pass out, Issei. Let's unpack."
2. The Strategy Session (Night 1)
Location: The Villa Living Room.
Dinner was finished. The atmosphere was heavy. Rias stood at the head of the table.
Rias: "Riser has 15 servants. A full set. We have... five. Kiba, Koneko, Akeno, Issei, Asia. And Ariel as support. The numbers are against us."
The peerage looked grim. They were powerful, but the math was bad.
Ariel stood up. He walked to the whiteboard Rias had set up.
Ariel: "The numbers don't matter. Riser is arrogant. That's his weakness. He thinks this is a show of force. We need to treat it like a Guerrilla Operation."
He drew a diagram of the Rating Game field (a replica of the school).
Ariel: "Riser's Queen, Yubelluna, is a bombardment mage. She'll try to level the playing field. Akeno-san, you need to intercept her. But don't duel her. Harass her. Make her waste mana chasing shadows."
He turned to Kiba.
Ariel: "Kiba, Riser has a Knight who relies on brute speed. You're faster, but you waste movement. I watched you spar. You flourish too much. We need to cut your movement economy by 20%."
He looked at Koneko.
Ariel: "Koneko-chan. You're the wall. But Riser's Rook is huge. Don't try to out-muscle him. I'm going to teach you Redirection. Let him throw the punch, you just guide it into the dirt."
And finally, Issei.
Ariel: "Issei. You're the Nuke. But a Nuke with a 10-second timer is useless if you miss. Your job isn't to fight the pawns. Your job is to survive until the path to Riser is clear."
Rias watched him. The "Human" was commanding her Devils with the precision of a veteran general.
Rias: "You have a plan for Riser himself?"
Ariel: "Riser regenerates. He's immortal. But he feels pain. And he has an ego. We don't beat him by killing him. We beat him by breaking his mind. We humiliate him until he makes a mistake."
The Peerage nodded. For the first time, they saw a path to victory.
3. The Hardening Grind (Day 2 - Morning)
Focus: PHY / Iron Body Durability.
The next morning, the physical training began. Issei was running up the mountain with tires tied to his waist. Kiba was cutting leaves.
Ariel approached Koneko. She was lifting a boulder the size of a car.
Ariel: "Koneko. I need a favor."
Koneko dropped the boulder. Thud.
Koneko: "What?"
Ariel: "My Iron Body (Tekkai) is weak. Riser's fire burned me because my density wasn't high enough. I need impact training."
He took off his shirt, revealing a body that was no longer soft. It was bruised, scarred from the light spear, and covered in healing scabs, but the muscle underneath was dense and corded.
Ariel: "Hit me."
Koneko blinked. "You're human. If I hit you, you die."
Ariel: "Not full power. Start at 10%. Use a training stick. I need to learn to tighten the muscle exactly when you strike. If I flinch, hit me harder."
Koneko stared at him. She saw the Veritas in his eyes. He wasn't being a masochist. He was forging himself.
Koneko: "Okay. Don't cry."
The Montage:
Whack.
Ariel grunted, locking his abs.
Whack.
Ariel hissed, tightening his obliques.
Whack.
He fell to one knee. "Again."
Issei ran past them, sweating. "Dude! She's gonna kill you!"
Ariel: "Shut up and run, Issei! Pain is just data!"
By the end of the session, Ariel’s torso was a map of purple bruises. But he was standing.
Koneko: "You're getting harder. Like stone."
Ariel: "Not stone yet. Iron."
[System Update: PHY 1.1 \rightarrow 1.2. Iron Body Duration increased to 2 seconds.]
4. The Dragon's Focus (Day 3 - Afternoon)
Focus: SPR / Willpower Training.
Issei was failing. He couldn't maintain the Boosted Gear for more than 10 seconds without it resetting. He was frustrated, kicking the dirt.
Issei: "It's useless! I'm not strong enough!"
Ariel walked over, limping slightly from the Koneko beatdown. He held a small, smooth stone in his hand.
Ariel: "Stop trying to force it with anger, Issei. Anger burns out."
Issei: "Then what do I use? Lust?"
Ariel: "Lust is fleeting. Use Will. Use Greed."
Ariel sat him down.
Ariel: "Look at this stone. I want you to pour your desire into it. Don't imagine naked girls. Imagine Protecting them. Imagine the feeling of holding Rias's hand. Imagine the feeling of Asia smiling. Pack all of that into this stone."
Issei closed his eyes. He focused. The Gauntlet appeared.
Boost. (1 second).
Boost. (5 seconds).
Issei started to shake. "It's... heavy."
Ariel: "Hold it. Riser is laughing at you. Riser is touching them. Do not let him."
Issei growled. The green light stabilized. It stopped flickering.
Boost. (10 seconds).
Boost. (12 seconds).
Boost. (15 seconds).
The gem glowed a brilliant, steady red.
Issei: "I... I'm doing it!"
Ariel: "That's it. That's Haki—I mean, Focus. The power to impose your reality on the world. Keep practicing that. Make that feeling your baseline."
5. The Midnight Shadow (Secret Training)
That night, while the Devils slept (recovering their magic), Ariel sneaked out to the balcony.
He accessed the PTD.
Ariel: "System. I can take a hit now. But I can't hit back. I need offense. Load the CQC (Close Quarters Combat) module. Metal Gear Solid 3: The Boss."
> Observer: "Loading Simulation: The Joy. Difficulty: Extreme."
> 
Ariel spent the night fighting a ghost of The Boss in a field of white flowers.
He learned to grab a wrist and snap it. He learned to use an enemy's momentum to slam them into the dirt.
He wasn't learning to punch harder; he was learning to dismantle opponents.
He woke up on the balcony floor at dawn, exhausted but sharper.
[System Update: MND 1.4 \rightarrow 1.5. CQC Proficiency: Beginner.]
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Iron Body leveling up. CQC unlocked. Relationship with Koneko (Training Partner) deepened.
 * Issei: Boosted Gear duration extended to 15 seconds via Will training.
 * Team: Strategy finalized. Morale is high.

## 📕 Chapter 15: The Speed of Sound and The Kiss of Lightning
Timeline: Training Camp Day 5 & Day 7.
Location: The Forest Clearing / The Waterfall.
1. Day 5: The Human vs. The Knight (CQC & Observation)
Focus: Reaction Speed & Redirection.
The morning mist was thick. Kiba Yuuto stood in the clearing, holding a wooden practice sword. He looked relaxed, but his aura felt sharp.
Ariel stood opposite him, unarmed. Echo sat on his head, tail wrapped tight around Ariel's neck.
Kiba: "Are you sure about this, Ariel? Without magic, my speed is... problematic for humans."
Ariel: "That's why we're doing this. Riser has a Knight. If I can't track you, I can't track him. Don't use magic. Just use physical speed. 50% output."
Kiba: "Understood. Begin."
WOOSH.
Kiba vanished. To a normal eye, he was gone.
To Ariel’s MND 1.5, he was a blur. But Ariel wasn't using his eyes.
Echo's tail tapped his left ear.
Ariel: Left.
Ariel didn't try to block. He pivoted on his heel, dropping his center of gravity.
The wooden sword slashed the space where his ribs had been a millisecond ago.
Kiba: "Hoh?"
Kiba reversed his grip and slashed upward.
Echo's tail tapped the back of Ariel's neck.
Ariel: Behind/Up.
Ariel didn't dodge this time. He stepped in.
[CQC Technique: Jamming]
He moved into Kiba’s personal space before the sword could gain momentum. He placed his palm on Kiba’s sword-hand wrist and pushed down while stepping past.
It was a redirection of force. Kiba’s own speed worked against him. His balance broke. He stumbled forward.
Ariel swept Kiba’s leg.
Thud.
Kiba hit the dirt. He rolled instantly, springing back up, eyes wide with excitement.
Kiba: "You... you used my speed to throw me. You didn't overpower me; you just... opened the door and let me fall through."
Ariel: (Breathing hard) "Efficiency, Kiba. You commit too hard to the strike. If someone steps inside your guard, you're vulnerable. That's what I meant by 'Economy of Motion'."
Kiba: "Amazing. Let's go again. 70% speed."
Ariel: "Wait, let me vomit first. My brain is lagging."
[System Update: MND 1.5 \rightarrow 1.6. CQC Proficiency: Intermediate.]
2. Day 7: The Sadistic Teacher (Nullification Training)
Focus: Magic Resistance & Nullification Intent.
Ariel stood under the spray of a small waterfall. He wasn't meditating; he was shivering.
Akeno Himejima stood on the bank, smiling her signature "Ara Ara" smile. Sparks of yellow lightning danced between her fingers.
Ariel: "Okay, Akeno-san. The goal is resistance. Riser uses Fire. You use Lightning. Both are plasma. If I can Reject your lightning, I can Reject his fire."
Akeno: "Are you sure, Ariel-kun? Lightning hurts deep. It cooks the nerves. It might make you cry."
Ariel: "I already cried during the stretching exercises. Just do it. Low voltage."
Akeno: "Very well. Zap."
She flicked a finger. A bolt of lightning arced toward Ariel’s chest.
It wasn't lethal, but it was enough to stun a boar.
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
Don't tank it with muscles. Muscles conduct electricity.
Tank it with Will.
Refuse the energy. Deny the circuit.
Ariel: "NO."
He pushed his SPR (0.35) out of his skin. He visualized a rubber suit. A wall of grey static.
CRACK.
The lightning hit him.
"GAAAAH!"
Ariel convulsed. The Nullification failed to stop it fully. Smoke rose from his wet hair.
Akeno: "Oh my. You took that better than I thought. Shall I continue?"
Ariel: (Twitching) "Again. Harder."
Akeno: (Eyes glowing with delight) "I like your spirit, Ariel-kun."
Zap. Zap. Zap.
For an hour, she acted as a human taser.
Ariel screamed. He fell. He got up.
But slowly, the screams got shorter.
He began to see the "Shape" of the magic. He learned to pulse his Will at the exact moment of contact to disperse the charge before it entered his heart.
By the final bolt, Ariel didn't scream. He just grunted, steam rising from his shoulders. He swatted the bolt aside with a blackened hand.
Ariel: "I... I felt it. I broke the circuit."
Akeno: "You did. Most Devils would have passed out ten minutes ago. You have a very stubborn soul, Ariel-kun."
Ariel: "Stubbornness is the only talent I have."
[System Update: SPR 0.35 \rightarrow 0.5. Skill Upgraded: Nullification Intent (Level 1 - 40% Reduction).]
📈 Status Update (End of Camp)
The 10 days are up. The Mortal Variable is forged.
 * PHY: 1.2 (Athletic, Hardened).
 * MND: 1.6 (Tactical Genius).
 * SPR: 0.5 (Awakened Will).
 * Skills: Iron Body (Lv 2), CQC (Intermediate), Observation (Echo-Sync), Nullification (Lv 1).
 * Team Morale: Maximum. Issei has unlocked his potential. Kiba is efficient. Koneko uses redirection. Akeno and Rias trust the strategy.

## 📕 Chapter 16: The Quiet Mind and The War Cry
Timeline: Day 10 (Sunset) & Day 11 (Morning of the Game).
Location: The Gremory Villa.
1. The Goku State (Day 10 - Sunset)
The sun was dipping below the mountain peaks. The rest of the peerage was doing last-minute panic training—Issei was doing pushups, Kiba was polishing his sword nervously.
Ariel sat on the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley. He sat in a full lotus position, hands resting on his knees. Echo sat quietly in his lap.
He wasn't moving. His breathing was so shallow it was almost invisible.
Issei: (Walking up, panting) "Ariel! Come on, man! One last spar? I need to keep the Boost active!"
Ariel didn't open his eyes.
Ariel: "No, Issei. The work is done."
Issei: "But Riser is tomorrow! If we stop now, we'll get rusty!"
Ariel: "Do you remember the Cell Games? Goku didn't train the day before. He relaxed. He let his body repair the micro-tears. He cleared his mind of doubt."
Ariel opened his eyes. They were clear. The panic that had driven him since the Raynare incident was gone, replaced by a cold, placid lake of Veritas.
Ariel: "If you train now, you're training fear. You're telling yourself you aren't ready. Sit down, Issei. Visualize the win. Don't fight the air; fight the doubt."
Issei hesitated, then sat next to him.
They sat in silence for an hour. Issei fidgeted at first, but slowly, Ariel’s calm Presence (early Haki manifestation) bled into him. The Red Dragon settled.

2. The War Room (Day 11 - Morning)
The morning of the Rating Game. The air was electric.
The Peerage gathered in the main hall, dressed in their battle gear.
Issei wore the school uniform (his armor). Kiba had his swords. Koneko had her gloves.
Rias stood at the front. She looked regal, but her hands were trembling slightly.
Rias: "This is it. The teleportation circle activates in ten minutes. Once we enter, there is no retreat."
She looked at Ariel.
Rias: "Tactician. Give us the field command."
Ariel stepped forward. He wore a simple tactical vest over his shirt (no weapons, just tools). He looked at each of them.
Ariel: "I won't lie to you. On paper, we lose. They have more pieces, more experience, and immortality."
He walked to the tactical map one last time.
Ariel: "But Riser is fighting a Tournament. We are fighting a War. He wants applause; we want survival. That is why we will win."
3. The Final Orders (Guerrilla Protocol)
Ariel pointed to the map of the school replica.
Ariel: "The plan remains 'Phantom Pain'."
 * To Kiba: "You are the Ghost. Hit their flanks. Cut a hamstring and vanish. Make them terrified of the shadows. Do not duel anyone until they are bleeding."
 * To Koneko: "You are the Wall. When they chase Kiba, you break their nose. Use the corridors. Force them into choke points where their numbers mean nothing."
 * To Akeno: "You are the Sky. If Yubelluna tries to bomb us, you punish her. Keep them looking up so they don't see the knife at their feet."
 * To Issei: "You are the King... disguised as a Pawn. Protect the President. Let them think you're weak. Let them mock you. And when Riser steps out of his castle to finish you..."
Ariel grabbed Issei’s shoulder, gripping it hard.
Ariel: "...you show him what a Dragon does to a Bird."
4. The Defiance
Ariel turned to Rias.
Ariel: "Kaichou. Riser thinks he owns you. Today, you remind him that a King does not bow to a firecracker."
Rias smiled. The trembling in her hands stopped. The Crimson aura flared around her, confident and destructive.
Rias: "Understood. We will crush them."
A magic circle appeared—the transport to the Rating Game dimension.
Grayfia's Voice: [Transport initiating. All participants, prepare for transfer.]
Ariel checked his belt. Flashlights. Smoke bombs. Fishing line.
And deep in his gut, the Spirit (SPR) he had forged in the fire.
Ariel: "Let's go teach an Immortal how to bleed."
The light consumed them.
📈 Status Update
 * Preparation: Complete.
 * Condition: Peak. All injuries healed. Minds focused.

## 📕 Chapter 16: The Quiet Mind and The War Cry
Timeline: Day 10 (Sunset) & Day 11 (Morning of the Game).
Location: The Gremory Villa.
1. The Goku State (Day 10 - Sunset)
The sun was dipping below the mountain peaks. The rest of the peerage was doing last-minute panic training—Issei was doing pushups, Kiba was polishing his sword nervously.
Ariel sat on the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley. He sat in a full lotus position, hands resting on his knees. Echo sat quietly in his lap.
He wasn't moving. His breathing was so shallow it was almost invisible.
Issei: (Walking up, panting) "Ariel! Come on, man! One last spar? I need to keep the Boost active!"
Ariel didn't open his eyes.

## 📕 Chapter 17: The Phantom Pain
Timeline: The Rating Game (Start).
Location: The Observation Room / The Replica School Battlefield.
1. The Eye in the Sky
Ariel stood in the Observation Room. It was a dark room filled with floating magical screens displaying every angle of the battlefield. Beside him sat Grayfia, silent and observant as the referee.
Ariel adjusted his headset.
Ariel: "Comms check. Sound off."
Rias: [King, standing by.]
Akeno: [Queen, ready to fly.]
Kiba: [Knight, in position.]
Koneko: [Rook, anchored.]
Issei: [Pawn... uh, I'm here! And I'm not freaking out!]
Ariel looked at the map. Riser’s team had deployed in a standard "Phalanx" formation—Rook and Knight in front, Queen and Bishop in back, Riser in the center. Arrogant. Predictable.
Ariel: "They are marching down the main street. They want a duel. We aren't giving them one. Phase 1: Operation Ghost. Execute."
2. The Ghost and The Wall
On the battlefield, Riser’s Knight (Karlamine) dashed forward, sword drawn.
Karlamine: "Come out, Gremory Knight! Face me!"
She saw Kiba standing in the middle of the track field.
Kiba didn't draw his sword. He smiled—a cold, efficient smile.
He turned and ran into the woods.
Karlamine: "Coward!"
She chased him. She was fast, but she was burning stamina. Kiba was using his new Economy of Motion, gliding over roots while she smashed through them.
Ariel (Comms): "Koneko. Vector 3-9. Intercept."
As Karlamine burst through a bush, expecting to catch Kiba, she didn't find the Knight.
She found The Wall.
Koneko was waiting behind a large oak tree. She didn't punch. She stepped into Karlamine's path and grabbed the Knight's wrist.
[Technique: Flow Redirection]
Karlamine’s supersonic speed turned against her. Koneko pivoted, using the Knight's momentum to hurl her face-first into the tree trunk.
CRACK.
The tree shattered. Karlamine collapsed, unconscious before she knew she was hit.
Grayfia's Voice: [Riser's Knight, Retired.]
3. The Bombardment
In the enemy base, Riser’s eyes twitched.
Riser: "They took out Karlamine? In ten seconds?"
Yubelluna (Queen): "It was a trap, Lord Riser."
Riser: "I don't care! Level the forest! Burn them out!"
Yubelluna flew into the air. She raised her staff.
Yubelluna: "Explosion!"
A massive barrage of magical bombs rained down on the forest. The ground shook. Trees were incinerated.
Issei (Comms): "Ariel! They're nuking the map! We're gonna get roasted!"
Ariel: "Calm down, Issei. Look at the pattern. She's angry. She's firing wide. Akeno-san, you have the vector."
4. The Lightning Snipe
Akeno was hiding in the clouds, suppressing her aura (Stealth training). She watched Yubelluna screaming and throwing bombs.
Ariel (Comms): "Target is stationary. She thinks she's safe because of her range. Punish her."
Akeno giggled.
Akeno: "Understood, Tactician."
She didn't use a massive storm. She pointed one finger.
[Technique: Holy Lightning - Precision Strike]
A single, concentrated bolt of yellow lightning shot down from the clouds. It struck Yubelluna directly in the solar plexus while she was casting.
ZAP.
Yubelluna: "KYAAA!"
The Bombardment Queen fell out of the sky, paralyzed by the shock. She crashed onto the school roof, twitching.
Ariel: "Don't finish her, Akeno. Let her live. An injured Queen demands resources to heal. A dead Queen is just a statistic. Make them carry her."
Ariel was playing cruel. By leaving Yubelluna alive but crippled, he forced Riser’s Bishop to stop healing the frontline and focus on the Queen. He split their support.
5. The Pawn's Debut
Riser was now down a Knight, and his Queen was grounded. He was furious.
Riser: "Send the Rook! And the Pawns! Crush the main building! The Red Dragon must be there!"
Riser’s Rook (Xuelan) and three Pawns charged the Old School Building.
They kicked down the doors.
Xuelan: "Come out, Dragon!"
The hallway was empty. Except for one boy standing at the far end.
Issei Hyoudou.
He wasn't wearing armor. He was standing in a relaxed stance, breathing slowly.
Ariel (Comms): "Issei. They are in the kill box. Remember the stone. Focus."
Issei closed his eyes.
Protect Rias. Protect Asia. Trust Ariel.
[BOOST! BOOST! BOOST!]
The sound was rhythmic. Controlled. The power didn't leak; it condensed.
Xuelan charged. "Die!"
Ariel: "Now."
Issei opened his eyes.
Issei: "DRAGON SHOT!"
He didn't fire a beam. He punched the air.
The condensed energy blast filled the narrow hallway. There was nowhere for the enemy to dodge. The physics of the corridor magnified the blast.
BOOM.
The front of the school building exploded outward.
Xuelan and the three Pawns were blasted out of the rubble, armor shattered, unconscious.
Grayfia's Voice: [Riser's Rook and Three Pawns, Retired.]
6. The Checkmate of Morale
In the Observation Room, Grayfia looked at the monitor, then at the human boy standing with his arms crossed.
Grayfia: "You dismantled half his peerage in five minutes. Without a single casualty."
Ariel watched Riser on the screen. The Phenex heir was shaking with rage, his composure gone.
Ariel: "He thought he was playing a game, Grayfia-sama. He didn't realize he walked into a meat grinder."
Ariel pressed the comms button.
Ariel: "All units. The enemy is disorganized and blind. Phase 2: The Hunt. Issei, retreat to the gymnasium. Kiba, Koneko... harvest the rest."
The Mortal Variable had turned the Rating Game into a nightmare for the Immortal Bird. But Ariel knew the hardest part was coming. Riser hadn't fought yet.
And a cornered beast burns hottest.
📈 Status Update
 * Riser's Team: -5 Members. Queen Critical. Morale: Broken.
 * Rias's Team: 0 Casualties. Energy Reserves: High.
 * Ariel: Successfully commanding the flow of battle.

## 📕 Chapter 19: The King’s Offer and The Library of Giants
Timeline: Two Days after the Rating Game (Weekend).
Location: Hyoudou Residence / The Occult Research Clubroom.
1. The Victory Feast
The Hyoudou living room was a disaster zone of pizza boxes, sushi platters, and soda bottles.
Issei was currently in a headlock by Koneko, who was punishing him for trying to look down her shirt, but she was smiling. Asia was laughing, feeding Echo (the lemur) slices of apple. Kiba and Akeno were debating the finer points of the battle strategy.
Ariel sat on the porch, looking at the moon. He held a can of coffee. His body was sore—the adrenaline crash from the Rating Game had left him physically drained, but mentally light.
We did it, Ariel thought. We actually beat the plot.
The sliding door opened. Rias Gremory stepped out. She wasn't wearing her school uniform or battle armor; she wore a simple summer dress. She looked... normal. And happy.
Rias: "Hiding from the chaos, Tactician?"
Ariel: "Just enjoying the silence, Kaichou. It’s rare around Issei."
Rias sat next to him. She didn't say anything for a long time. She just looked at the moon.
Rias: "My father called. And Sirzechs. They are... confused. They can't understand how a low-class peerage decimated a high-class veteran. Riser is humiliated. The engagement is officially void."
Ariel: "Good. Issei earned it."
Rias: "Issei fought. You won it."
Rias turned to him. Her expression was serious. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small velvet box. She opened it.
Inside sat a Mutation Piece (Mutated Pawn). It glowed with a deep, powerful crimson light.
Rias: "Ariel Caelum Veritas. I am formally inviting you to join my Peerage. With this piece, you would be reincarnated as a Devil. You would gain a lifespan of thousands of years, magic power, and the physical durability you desperately need."
She offered it to him.
Rias: "You wouldn't be a servant. You would be my right hand. My Strategist. Please. Join us properly."
2. The Refusal (Veritas)
Ariel looked at the piece. It was tempting. Instant power. No more broken bones from simple punches. Immortality.
He looked at Rias. He saw the hope in her eyes.
He reached out and gently closed the box.
Ariel: "I can't, Rias."
Rias blinked, hurt flashing across her face. "Why? Do you not trust me?"
Ariel: "I trust you with my life. That's not it."
Ariel leaned back, looking at his scarred hands.
Ariel: "If I become a Devil, everything I did... it loses its meaning. I fought Riser to prove that you don't need to be 'Born Special' to win. I fought to prove that a Human—a weak, mortal human—can stand on the same stage as monsters."
He looked at her, his eyes burning with Veritas.
Ariel: "If I take that piece, I'm just another Devil using Devil magic. I lose my Variable. I lose the perspective that let me beat Riser. I need to stay Human, Rias. I need to climb the mountain with my own legs."
Rias stared at him. Then, a slow, proud smile spread across her face. She put the box away.
Rias: "You really are the most stubborn man I've ever met."
Ariel: "It's my best quality."
Rias: "Very well. You remain our Human Ally. But... you said you wanted to climb the mountain. You've hit your limit as a human, haven't you?"
Ariel: "Yeah. My body is capped. I need to break the ceiling."
Rias: "Then let us help you. You trained us. Now, let us provide the facility for you to train us properly."
3. The Opening of the Dojo (Monday Afternoon)
Location: The Old School Building Gym (Renovated).
Ariel gathered the Peerage. He stood in the center of the gym.
He had made a decision. To survive the next wave (Kokabiel, the White Dragon), he couldn't hoard his secrets anymore.
Ariel: "Okay. Rias knows I turned down the Devil Piece. But I'm not stopping. In fact, I'm accelerating."
Issei: "Accelerating? Dude, you already punch fire."
Ariel: "That was a parlor trick. Today, I'm showing you the Source."
Ariel activated the PTD—but he projected it outward, using the Gremory magic circle Rias had set up to amplify his thoughts into holograms (a cover for the PTD technology).
Ariel: "I call this The Library of Legends. These are the warriors I study. These are the peaks I am chasing."
4. The Three Pillars of Power
Huge holographic screens appeared around the gym, displaying scenes from Ariel's memory archives.
A. The Will (One Piece)
A screen showed Monkey D. Garp throwing a cannonball. It showed Vergo covering his body in black Haki.
Ariel: "This is Armament and Observation. It is the art of turning Willpower into Armor and Radar.
 * Koneko: This is for you. Absolute Defense.
 * Kiba: This is for you. Cutting what cannot be cut."
B. The Energy (Dragon Ball)
A screen showed Goku firing a Kamehameha. It showed Vegeta training in 100x Gravity.
Ariel: "This is Ki Control and Limit Breaking.
 * Issei: This is you. Your Boosted Gear is a multiplier. If your base strength is 5, a boost makes it 10. If your base is 50, a boost makes it 100. We are going to break your base limits."
C. The Technique (Manhwa/MGS)
A screen showed Snake using CQC. It showed Dokgo Ryong destroying a cliff with a palm strike.
Ariel: "This is Efficiency.
 * Rias & Akeno: You have nukes, but you aim them slowly. I will teach you how to be snipers."
5. The Curriculum Begins
The images faded. The Peerage looked at Ariel with awe. He wasn't just a smart kid anymore; he was the keeper of lost arts.
Ariel: "I'm going to teach you everything. But fair warning... the training to achieve this? It makes the mountain camp look like a spa day."
He looked at Issei.
Ariel: "Issei. First lesson. Dragon Ball Gravity Theory. Rias, can you increase the gravity in this room with magic?"
Rias: "Easily. How much?"
Ariel: "Double it. Let's see if the Dragon can walk."
Rias cast the spell. The air shimmered.
THOOM.
Issei slammed face-first into the floor mat.
Issei: "GHHH! MY LUNCH!"
Ariel stood there, his knees shaking, sweat instantly popping on his forehead, but he remained standing. He had done this in the PTD.
Ariel: "Stand up, Issei! If you can't stand in 2x, you can't beat a White Dragon!"
Koneko walked into the gravity field. She felt lighter than usual (Rook strength). She looked at Ariel.
Koneko: "This is good. I like heavy."
Ariel: "Good. Koneko, you're my sparring partner. I need you to beat me up until my skin learns to be steel."
Koneko: (Cracking her knuckles) "With pleasure."
The Veritas Dojo was officially open.
📈 Status Update
 * Ariel: Rejected Devilhood (Humanity retained). Established as "The Sensei."
 * Peerage: Accepted Ariel’s leadership in training.
 * Plot: The "Slice of Life / Training Arc" has begun. The next major threat (Holy Sword Arc) is weeks away.

## 📕 Final Chapter (Demo Version): The Mortal's Truth
Timeline: Post-Riser Victory Celebration.
Location: Occult Research Clubroom.
1. The Tension in the Room
Instead of a pure party, there is an undercurrent of unease.
Issei is celebrating, but Kiba, Koneko, and Rias are watching Ariel.
Ariel is sitting in the corner, nursing his bandaged hand. He realizes the "Friendly Neighbor" act is crumbling. They saw him punch magic. They saw him command a war.
Rias: "Everyone, quiet down."
The room goes silent. Rias walks to Ariel.
Rias: "Ariel. We won. We are grateful. But I cannot have an unknown variable in my peerage's inner circle. Grayfia suspects you are a spy. My brother suspects you are a dormant dragon. Who are you?"
Kiba’s hand drifts near his sword. Not out of malice, but out of uncertainty.
The friendship is on the line.
2. The Veritas Decision
Ariel looks at them. He sees the fear in Rias's eyes. He realizes that if he keeps the secret, he loses them.
Ariel: "I'm not a spy, Rias. I'm not a dragon."
He stands up. He walks to the center of the room.
Ariel: "I held back during the training camp. I showed you the tactics, but I didn't show you the Engine. I didn't show you why I can do these things."
Issei: "Dude, just tell us. You're our friend."
Ariel: "That's why I'm doing this. Because friends don't let friends fight blind."
3. The Revelation (The Climax)
Ariel activates the PTD Projection (The Library of Legends).
This time, the projection is massive. It fills the room with the overwhelming pressure of the Archives.
Ariel: "This is my reality. I don't have magic. I have Data and Will."
He shows them:
 * Garp punching a mountain (The source of his Iron Body).
 * Katakuri dodging bullets (The source of his Observation).
 * Dokgo Ryong shattering a cliff (The source of his future potential).
The peerage is stunned. They aren't looking at "Cartoons." They are looking at possibilities they never imagined.
Ariel: "I study them. I simulate them. I break my body every night trying to mimic a fraction of their power. That's the secret, Rias. I'm just a guy who refuses to accept that 'Human' means 'Weak'."
4. The Offer (Tweaked)
Rias looks at the images. She looks at Ariel. The fear is gone, replaced by awe.
She pulls out the Mutation Pawn Piece.
Rias: "Ariel. With this drive... and a Devil's body... you could surpass us all. Join me. Become my Pawn. We can climb that mountain together, forever."
Ariel looks at the piece. The red light is seductive.
He reaches out... and closes her hand over it.
Ariel: "Not yet, Kaichou."
Rias: "Why? You're injured. You're human. You will die eventually."
Ariel: "That's the point. I punched Riser's fire as a human. If I turn into a Devil now... I'll never know how far I could have gone on my own."
He smiles—a fearless, truthful smile.
Ariel: "Keep it for me. If I hit a wall I absolutely cannot break... I'll ask for it. But for now? I want to see if a human can reach the Heavens (Caelum)."
5. The Demo Ending
Rias puts the piece away, but she keeps her hand on his.
Rias: "Very well. Then as a Human... will you teach us?"
Issei: "Yeah! Teach me how to do that 'Haki' thing!"
Kiba: "I want to see the sword techniques of that 'Zoro' figure."
Koneko: "I want to punch mountains."
Ariel looks at his friends. He looks at the hologram of the Straw Hat pirates sailing into the sunset.
He grins.
Ariel: "Class is in session. First lesson: Gravity."
[Scene Fade Out]
[Text on Screen]: The Mortal Variable has only just begun.

## 📕 Revised Chapter 13: The First Warning (The Aura Clash)
Context: Riser’s Arrival at the Clubroom (Pre-Training Camp).
Instead of just punching a fireball, Ariel needs to show Dominance.
The Scene:
Riser is mocking Issei. He flares his aura, heating the room to 50 degrees Celsius. The weak (Asia) are fainting.
Riser: "Kneel before the sun, insects!"
Ariel doesn't just punch a fireball. He steps forward.
He stomps the floor.
[Technique: Grounding / Intimidation (Primitive Conqueror's)]
THOOM.
The room shakes physically.
Ariel projects his Will so densely that it disrupts Riser's control over the atmosphere. The heat vanishes instantly, replaced by a chilling, heavy pressure.
Ariel: "You're too loud. Sit down."
Riser’s knees buckle involuntarily. He catches himself, furious and terrified.
Riser: "What... gravity magic?!"
Ariel: "No. Just gravity."
Why it works: Rias sees Riser (a High-Class Devil) forced to kneel by a human's presence. That is the seed of fear.
## 📕 Revised Climax: The Undying Will vs. The Immortal Bird
Timeline: Immediately after Issei defeats Riser in the Game.
Location: The Occult Research Clubroom (Real World).
1. The Broken Promise
Issei is unconscious on the sofa, exhausted from the fight. Rias is tending to him.
The magic circle flares. Riser Phenex returns. He is fully healed (physically), but his ego is shattered.
Riser: "I do not accept this! A Pawn? Defeating ME?!"
Rias: "The game is over, Riser. Leave."
Riser: "No! The engagement stands! I will take you by force if I have to!"
Riser’s eyes glow with madness. He charges a massive sphere of Hellfire, aiming it not at Rias, but at the sleeping Issei.
Riser: "If the Pawn is ash, the game is void!"
2. The Mortal Shield
Rias screams, raising a shield, but she is too slow.
Ariel moves. He was standing by the window. He uses Burst Speed.
He stands over Issei.
He doesn't have gadgets. He doesn't have a plan. He has Iron Body.
Ariel: "OVER MY DEAD BODY!"
BOOM.
The explosion engulfs the room.
Smoke fills the air.
Riser laughs. "Burned to nothing!"
The smoke clears.
Ariel is standing. His clothes are incinerated. His skin is scorched black. But he hasn't moved an inch. Issei is untouched beneath him.
3. The Nullification Beatdown
Ariel looks up. His eyes are white with fury.
Ariel: "You tried to kill a sleeping man."
Ariel steps forward. The burned skin on his arms cracks, revealing... not blood, but Grey Hardened Muscle (Tekkai pushed to the limit).
Riser panics. He throws a spear of fire.
Ariel backhands it. The fire dissipates into nothingness upon contact with his hand.
[Nullification Intent: Active]
Ariel grabs Riser by the throat.
Riser: "Let go! I am Immortal! I will regenerate!"
Ariel squeezes. He pours his SPR into Riser's neck.
Ariel: "Heal then."
He punches Riser in the stomach. CRACK.
Riser coughs blood. He tries to activate his healing flame.
Ariel Glares.
Ariel: "NO."
The healing flame flickers and dies. Ariel's Will is actively suppressing Riser's biological magic.
Riser: "Why... why can't I heal?!"
Ariel punches him again. And again. A brutal, rhythmic beatdown.
Ariel: "Because I'm not giving you permission."
4. The Intervention
Riser is a bloody mess. He is terrified. He is mortal.
Ariel raises his fist for a lethal blow. He intends to end it.
Sirzechs Lucifer (Hologram/Teleport) appears.
Sirzechs: "Enough, Human."
A massive wave of Power of Destruction pushes Ariel back gently.
Ariel skids to a halt, panting. His Iron Body deactivates. He collapses, bleeding from a dozen burns.
Riser crawls away, sobbing. "He's a monster... keep him away..."
5. The Fear (The Revised Revelation Context)
Rias stares at Ariel.
She sees Riser—an Immortal Phoenix—broken and unable to heal because a Human told him not to.
This defies the laws of their reality.
Rias's Thought: If he can turn off Immortality... he can kill Devils. He can kill Gods. He isn't just an ally. He is a weapon of mass destruction.
This creates the Urgency. Rias needs to know what he is, not out of curiosity, but out of safety for her world.
📝 Narrative Conclusion
Does this "Sore Loser Beatdown" provide the weight and fear you were looking for? It cements Ariel as the guy who does the dirty work that the "Hero" (Issei) can't or won't do.

## 🌩️ Scenario B: The Cage of Embers (The Sore Loser)
Context: The Rating Game is over. Issei won. The team is back in the Clubroom. Issei is unconscious from exhaustion.
1. The Lock
The victory celebration was cut short. The magic circle flared, but it wasn't the normal transport. It was Gold and Black.
Riser Phenex stepped out. He wasn't wounded anymore (regenerated), but his clothes were tattered and his eyes were bloodshot.
Rias: "Riser. You lost. Get out."
Riser didn't speak. He held up a golden amulet—an ancient Phenex artifact.
Riser: "Ignis Aeterna. Seal."
FLASH.
A dome of golden fire expanded instantly, encompassing the entire room.
Rias, Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko fell to their knees, clutching their chests. Their Demonic Aura was suffocated. The "Cage" was designed to suppress Devil magic to prevent infighting during high-stress negotiations.
Rias: (Gasping) "My... power... can't move..."
Riser: "A Phenex heirloom. It freezes the flow of Demonic energy. Now... nobody can save your pet dragon."
Riser walked toward the sofa where Issei lay unconscious.
Riser: "I will burn him to ash. Then the game is void."
2. The Variable
Riser formed a blade of fire. He raised it over Issei’s chest.
The Devils were paralyzed. The Human was not.
Ariel: "Hey."
Riser paused. He looked to the corner.
Ariel was standing up. He rolled his shoulders. He felt the heat of the room, but no paralysis.
Ariel's Internal Monologue: System check. Gravity? Normal. Magic suppression? Irrelevant. I don't use magic.
Riser: "You... why can you move? You're with them!"
Ariel: "I told you. I'm human. Your fancy toy doesn't work on me."
Ariel stepped between Riser and Issei.
Ariel: "You lost the game. You lost the girl. Now you're losing your dignity. Leave."
Riser: "Dignity?! I AM A GOD!"
Riser thrust the fire blade at Ariel’s heart.
3. The Beatdown (The Nullification Reveal)
Ariel: [Iron Body (Tekkai) + Nullification Intent]
Ariel didn't dodge. He caught the blade with his bare hand.
HISSS.
The fire tried to burn him. Ariel’s skin blackened, but his Will pushed back.
Ariel: "No."
He squeezed. The fire blade shattered into sparks.
Riser’s eyes bulged. "Impossible!"
Ariel didn't give him time to think.
[CQC: Disarm & Dismantle]
Ariel stepped in. He grabbed Riser’s wrist and hyperextended the elbow.
SNAP.
Riser screamed. "GAH! My arm!"
Ariel swept Riser’s legs, slamming the Immortal Devil onto the floor.
Riser tried to scramble away, his arm already snapping back into place with a sickening crunch of regeneration.
Riser: "I heal! I am eternal!"
Ariel mounted him. He pinned Riser’s shoulders with his knees.
Ariel: "You heal because the world lets you. I don't."
Ariel raised his fist. He focused his SPR. He visualized the concept of "Stasis."
Don't let him heal. Deny the magic.
THUD.
Ariel punched Riser in the face. The nose shattered.
Riser tried to heal. Ariel pulsed his Intent.
Ariel: "Stay broken."
The nose didn't heal. The blood kept flowing.
Riser felt true pain—lasting pain—for the first time in centuries.
Riser: "STOP! IT HURTS! WHY DOES IT HURT?!"
Ariel punched him again.
THUD.
Ariel: "Because you're weak."
THUD.
Ariel: "Because you're a bully."
THUD.
Ariel: "Because you touched my friends."
4. The Horror of the Spectators
Rias, paralyzed on the floor, watched in horror.
She saw a human teenager beating an Ultimate-Class Devil into a bloody pulp.
She saw Riser—who should be healing instantly—bruised, bleeding, and begging.
Rias's Thought: He’s not using magic. He’s using Command. He is telling Riser's biology to stop working. That isn't a technique... that's the power of a God.
5. The End
Ariel raised his fist for a lethal blow to the throat. He was going to crush Riser’s windpipe and hold it closed.
Sirzechs Lucifer (Hologram) appeared in the center of the room, breaking through the artifact's interference.
Sirzechs: "ARIEL VERITAS. STAND DOWN."
The voice of the Satan carried absolute authority. Ariel froze.
He looked at his bloody fist. He looked at Riser, who was sobbing.
Ariel exhaled. The "Iron Body" faded. He stood up, wiping blood on his pants.
Ariel: "He tried to kill Issei. I stopped him."
Sirzechs looked at Riser's battered, non-healing face. His expression was unreadable, but his aura flickered with wary respect.
Sirzechs: "So I see. The Phenex family will collect him. And we... will have a conversation later."

## 🌩️ Scenario A: The Cheat Code (The Mid-Game Duel)
Context: Mid-Rating Game. Riser is losing pieces to Ariel's strategies.
1. The Breach
In the Observation Room, Ariel was issuing commands.
Ariel: "Kiba, shift left. Koneko, prepare the ambush."
Suddenly, the screen showed Riser stopping in the middle of the battlefield. He wasn't fighting. He was looking up—directly at the sky camera.
Riser: "I know you're watching, Tactician."
Riser pulled out a Black Pawn Piece (an illegal, corrupted piece). He crushed it.
Riser: "Admin Privilege: Forced Duel."
A jagged rift in space tore open inside the Observation Room.
Grayfia: "Lord Riser! That is a violation of—"
Before Grayfia could stop it, a massive hand of fire reached out of the rift and grabbed Ariel.
Ariel: "Whoa—!"
He was yanked through space.
2. The Isolation Zone
Ariel crashed onto a floating platform in a "Null Space" between the game map and reality. It was just him and Riser. No Peerage. No Rias.
Riser: "There. No more pawns. No more tricks. Just you and me, human."
Riser ignited his wings.
Riser: "You humiliated me. You made my peerage look like fools. Now, I'm going to roast you alive while your friends watch on the monitors."
Ariel's Internal Monologue:
He separated me. He thinks I'm just a brain. He thinks I'm defenseless.
Good.
3. The Survival Horror
Riser launched a barrage of fireballs.
Ariel activated Observation (Echo-Sync). He couldn't use gadgets here. He had to move.
He dodged. He weaved.
Left. Right. Duck.
Riser: "Stop moving!"
Riser flew in for a grapple. He wanted to crush Ariel.
Ariel waited.
Ariel: "Closer..."
When Riser grabbed him, Ariel didn't pull away. He stepped into the guard.
[CQC: Joint Lock]
Ariel grabbed Riser’s thumb and twisted it 180 degrees.
SNAP.
Riser: "ARGH!"
Riser pulled back, his thumb regenerating.
Riser: "You... you know martial arts? Useless!"
Riser covered his body in a Fire Aura (Flame Body).
Riser: "Touch me now! You'll melt!"
4. The Will vs. The Element
Ariel stood his ground. He couldn't touch Riser without burning.
Ariel: "System. I need to touch him. I need to hit the solid part."
He remembered the One Piece Archive. He remembered Vergo.
Coat the limb. Don't just harden the muscle. Harden the Spirit.
Ariel focused his SPR. He couldn't do full Armament yet. He focused it all into his right leg.
[Technique: Iron Leg (Rankyaku) + Nullification Intent]
Riser charged.
Ariel kicked. He didn't kick Riser; he kicked the fire aura surrounding Riser's ribs.
His intent pierced the flame.
BOOM.
His shin connected with Riser’s ribs. The fire parted.
Riser was launched backward, crashing into the invisible wall of the Null Space.
Riser: "You... you kicked through my aura?!"
Ariel: "I told you. I hate bullies."
5. The Checkmate
Ariel was panting. His leg was scorched, his pants burned away. He couldn't keep this up.
But he didn't have to win. He just had to survive.
Suddenly, the barrier shattered.
Issei (in Balance Breaker form) smashed through the Null Space wall. Rias had poured all her power into boosting Issei to break the illegal dimension.
Issei: "GET AWAY FROM HIM!"
Issei tackled Riser.
Ariel collapsed, his job done. He had survived 5 minutes alone with a monster.

## 📕 Chapter 19: The Devil King’s Verdict
Timeline: Immediate Aftermath of the "Sore Loser" Incident.
Location: Occult Research Clubroom (Ruined).
1. The Silence of the King
The golden fire of Riser's "Cage" dissipated as Sirzechs Lucifer waved his hand.
Rias, Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko gasped, air filling their lungs as the suppression lifted. They didn't stand up immediately. They were staring at the center of the room.
Riser Phenex lay in a heap, whimpering, clutching a nose that was still bleeding because Ariel’s Will hadn't faded yet.
Ariel stood over him, swaying. His shirt was gone, burned away. His torso was a map of third-degree burns and black bruises where Iron Body had barely held. His knuckles were split to the bone.
Sirzechs: "Grayfia. Collect Lord Riser. He requires... extensive healing."
Grayfia: "Yes, Lucifer-sama."
Grayfia stepped forward. She looked at Ariel. For the first time, the stoic maid looked unsettled. She picked up Riser effortlessly and vanished in a silver circle.
Sirzechs turned to Ariel. The pressure in the room was suffocating—not hot like Riser's, but heavy, like the bottom of the ocean.
Sirzechs: "Ariel Caelum Veritas."
Ariel spat a mouthful of blood on the floor. He tried to stand at attention, but his leg gave out. He fell to one knee.
Ariel: "Sirzechs-sama. Sorry about the mess."
Sirzechs: "You stopped a Phenex from regenerating. That is theoretically impossible for a human. Even for most Devils."
Sirzechs walked closer.
Sirzechs: "My sister reported you as a Tactician. A human with keen eyes. She did not report you as a God-Slayer class anomaly."
2. The Veritas Defense
Rias scrambled to her feet, rushing to put herself between her brother and Ariel.
Rias: "Brother! Wait! He saved Issei! Riser broke the rules! He tried to kill a sleeping Pawn!"
Sirzechs: "I know, Rias. I watched. Riser will be punished. But that does not explain him."
Sirzechs looked down at Ariel.
Sirzechs: "What are you? A Reincarnated Angel? A Dragon in disguise? A descendant of Heroes?"
Ariel looked up. He was exhausted, in pain, and terrified. But he was Veritas.
Ariel: "I'm a high school student. My grades are average. I like cooking."
Sirzechs narrowed his eyes. "Do not lie to me."
Ariel: "I'm not lying. I have no magic. No Sacred Gear. Check me."
Sirzechs extended a hand. A pulse of Power of Destruction scanned Ariel’s body.
Scan Result: Human. 100% Human. Biological density is abnormal (PHY 1.2), but there is no magic source.
Sirzechs pulled his hand back, genuinely confused.
Sirzechs: "Then how? How did you punch fire? How did you stop his healing?"
Ariel: "I refused."
Sirzechs: "You... refused?"
Ariel: "Riser's power is based on his belief that he is eternal. My power is based on the belief that I am harder than he is. I just wanted it more. I imposed my Will on his reality."
Ariel pointed to his own head.
Ariel: "It's not magic, Sirzechs-sama. It's Mind over Matter. I just trained my mind until matter started listening."
3. The Verdict
Sirzechs stared at Ariel for a long moment. Then, a slow, amused smile broke his stoic face. The crushing pressure vanished.
Sirzechs: "A human who 'Refuses' magic. Interesting. Azazel would love to dissect you."
Ariel flinched. "Please don't let him."
Sirzechs: "Relax. You saved my sister's future. And you protected the Red Dragon Emperor. The Underworld owes you a debt."
Sirzechs turned to Rias.
Sirzechs: "Rias. You have a dangerous pet. Keep him close. If the Old Satan Faction learns a human can nullify immortality, they will send assassins. He is under your protection now."
Rias: "Yes, Brother."
Sirzechs: "Rest now. The engagement is void. You have won."
Sirzechs vanished in a circle of crimson light.
The moment he was gone, Ariel collapsed face-first onto the floor.
Ariel: "I think... I'm gonna pass out now."
Koneko: "Idiot." (She caught him before his head hit the ground).

## 📕 Chapter 20: The Truth Session
Timeline: Three Days Later.
Location: Hyoudou Residence (Ariel is recovering there again).
1. The Awakening (Round 2)
Issei was sitting by the bed peeling an apple. Ariel woke up groggy.
Issei: "You know, you spend way too much time in this bed."
Ariel: "Stop getting almost-killed, and I'll stop jumping in front of bullets."
Issei stopped peeling. He looked serious.
Issei: "I saw the room, Ariel. When I woke up. The scorch marks on the walls. Riser's face... it was caved in."
Issei looked at his friend with a mix of awe and fear.
Issei: "You beat him. I needed the Boosted Gear and a strategy just to knock him out. You beat him half to death with your bare hands. Who are you?"
Ariel sat up. His burns were bandaged.
Ariel: "Gather the others, Issei. Rias, Akeno, everyone. It's time for the Lesson."
2. The Classroom of Legends
The Peerage gathered in the living room. They looked at Ariel differently now. Not just as a friend, but as a heavy-hitter.
Ariel stood by a whiteboard he had dragged in.
Ariel: "Sirzechs asked how I did it. I told him it was Willpower. That was the simple answer. The real answer is... I have Teachers."
Rias: "Teachers? You mean masters? Where?"
Ariel: "In here." He tapped his head. "And in the data of other worlds."
Ariel activated the PTD Projection (disguised as a visual aid spell).
Ariel: "What I used on Riser is called Armament (Busoshoku). It creates invisible armor. It allows you to touch things that aren't solid—like fire, light, or ghosts."
He pointed to Koneko.
Ariel: "Koneko. You have the strength, but you take damage. If you learn this, you become the Unbreakable Rook. You can punch lightning without getting shocked."
He changed the slide to Observation (Kenbunshoku).
Ariel: "This is how I sensed Raynare. Sensing intent. Kiba, if you master this, you never have to guess where the enemy is. You'll know before they do."
He changed the slide to Dragon Ball (Ki Control).
Ariel: "And Issei. Your power is finite right now because you leak energy. You shout and it explodes. This technique teaches you to keep the explosion inside until you hit the target. Efficiency."
3. The Offer (The Mentor)
Rias looked at the diagrams.
Rias: "These techniques... they are not Devil magic. They are purely physical and spiritual disciplines."
Ariel: "Exactly. Which means they can't be sealed by artifacts like Riser's Cage. They are the Variable."
Ariel looked at them.
Ariel: "I turned down your Evil Piece, Rias. Because I want to see how far a human can go. But I can't do it alone anymore. I need sparring partners who can survive these techniques."
He extended a hand.
Ariel: "I'm opening a Dojo. The Veritas Dojo. 6:00 AM. Every day. It will hurt. You will want to quit. But if you stick with me... we'll make the Rating Game look like a tutorial."
Issei: (Standing up) "I'm in! I want to be able to punch a Maou!"
Kiba: (Smiling) "To cut the intent... yes. I will join."
Koneko: "I want to be harder than you."
Akeno: "Ara ara. Physical training isn't my style... but I do like seeing you sweat, Ariel-kun."
Rias: "Then it is decided. The Gremory Peerage accepts your curriculum, Sensei."
4. The Cliffhanger
As they celebrated the new alliance, Ariel’s MND pinged.
[System Alert: New Narrative Arc Detected.]
He looked out the window.
In the distance, near the town square, he saw two figures walking.
One with blue hair and a green streak (Xenovia). One with twin-tails (Irina).
They were carrying long, wrapped bundles on their backs. Holy Swords.
Ariel’s eyes narrowed.
Ariel: "Class starts tomorrow. And we need to hurry."
Issei: "Why?"
Ariel: "Because the Church is coming. And they aren't as nice as Asia."
🏁 End of "Scenario B" Narrative Arc
We have successfully:
 * Resolved the Riser Threat with high stakes.
 * Established Ariel's Power Level (Can beat a High-Class Devil in specific conditions, but takes heavy damage).
 * Unified the Team under Ariel's training.
 * Teased the Next Arc (Kokabiel/Holy Swords).
This completes the Remastered Demo.

## 🌌 Phase 4 (Remastered): The Library of Legends
Location: Occult Research Clubroom (Post-Victory).
Time: Thursday Evening.
1. The Question of Origin
The celebration had died down. The unease was palpable. Rias stood before Ariel, the Mutation Pawn piece in her hand, her eyes searching his.
Rias: "Ariel-kun. You stopped an Immortal's regeneration with a punch. You predicted every move of a Rating Game. You aren't a Devil. You aren't a Fallen Angel. And Sirzechs confirmed you have no Sacred Gear. What are you?"
Ariel looked at his friends. He saw Kiba's intense curiosity, Koneko's silent respect, and Issei's confusion. He realized the "Friendly Neighbor" act was over. To keep them as allies, he had to show them the engine under the hood.
Ariel: "I'm a student, Rias. But I don't study math or history."
He stood up and walked to the center of the room.
Ariel: "I study Gods."
He raised his hand. "System. Archive: Multi-Verse Overview. Full Projection. Authorization: Veritas."
The room dissolved. The PTD overrode the local reality, turning the clubroom into a galaxy of floating screens, each playing a loop of a different reality.
2. The Foundation: The Soldier (Survival)
Ariel pointed to the first set of screens. They were gritty, realistic, and violent.
They showed men in camouflage, mercenaries in suits, and spies in tactical gear.
 * Solid Snake / Big Boss (Metal Gear) using CQC to disarm soldiers.
 * Kang Chan (God of Blackfield) dismantling a squad with a knife.
 * Ijin Yu (Mercenary Enrollment) neutralizing threats with terrifying efficiency.
Ariel: "This is where I started. Before I could fight magic, I had to master reality. You asked how I knew Riser's tactics? How I knew to use flour bombs and friction traps?"
He pointed to Big Boss.
Ariel: "I lived their lives in the simulation. I learned that when you have no power, you use the environment. You use psychology. These men were the Peak of Soldiers. They taught me how to survive."
Kiba: "So your strategy isn't magic... it's war experience?"
Ariel: "Thousands of hours of it."
3. The Current Struggle: The Broken God (Technique)
Ariel swiped the air. The screens changed. The power level spiked.
The screens now showed a young man with messy hair and scars, fighting gods with just kicks.
 * Mori Dan (God of High School).
Ariel: "Right now, this is who I am. That is Mori Dan. He was once a Supreme God, but he lost his power. His body was broken. He had to fight entities capable of destroying worlds using only Martial Arts."
The screen showed Mori Dan bending space with a kick, not through magic, but through Recoilless technique—perfect physics.
Ariel: "He taught me that if your technique is perfect enough, physics will bend the knee. I am the Mortal Variable trying to kick down the door of the Supernatural with a broken body."
4. The Aspirations: The Third Variable (Dominance)
Ariel brought up two terrifying images. The room grew cold.
 * Aizen Sousuke (Bleach): Stopping a bankai sword with one finger.
 * Acnologia (Fairy Tail): A man transforming into a Dragon, ripping the sky apart.
Ariel: "I don't agree with their evil. But I admire their Absolute Presence."
He pointed to Aizen stopping the sword.
Ariel: "Look at that. He didn't use a spell. He didn't dodge. He just exerted so much Pressure (Reiatsu) that the sword couldn't cut him. That is what I did to Riser's fire. I want to reach a level where my Will is so dense that magic simply fails in my presence."
He pointed to Acnologia.
Ariel: "And him. In a war between Humans and Dragons, he was the Third Side. He ended the war by destroying both armies. That is the Silhouette. Uncontrollable. Unpredictable. That is why I can't join your peerage, Rias. I can't be a piece on the board. I have to be the hand that flips the table."
5. The Human Apex: The Heavenly Destroyer (Destruction)
Ariel swiped again. The art style shifted to ink-wash and mountains.
 * Dokgo Ryong (Gosu).
Ariel: "But can a human truly break a mountain? Yes."
The screen showed Dokgo Ryong unleashing a Divine Technique. He waved his hand, and a canyon appeared where a mountain range used to be.
Ariel: "He is the Heavenly Destroyer. A human martial artist who cultivated his inner energy to the point of natural disaster. While Aizen stops swords, Dokgo Ryong reshapes maps. This is my benchmark for Physical Destruction. If I reach this level... Riser's immortality won't matter, because there won't be anything left of him to regenerate."
6. The Ultimate Goal: The Sky (Divinity)
Finally, Ariel expanded the center screen. It eclipsed everything else.
 * Dragon Ball Super.
 * Goku (Ultra Instinct) dodging without thought.
 * Beerus (God of Destruction) tapping a table and erasing a planet.
 * Whis (Angel) reversing time.
The peerage stared in silence. The scale of power on the screen was beyond comprehension.
Ariel: "And this... is the Sky (Caelum). The Gods of Destruction. The Angels. They don't fight; they Erasure. They exist in a state of 'Auto-Pilot' where the body moves faster than the speed of thought."
Ariel turned to the Peerage. He looked small against the backdrop of these cosmic giants, but his eyes were fierce.
Ariel: "I am currently at the level of a Soldier (MGS). I am reaching for the level of a Pirate King (One Piece). But one day... I want to stand there."
He pointed at Beerus.
Ariel: "I want to be the Mortal who walked into the realm of Gods through pushups and stubbornness. That is my Truth."
7. The Invitation
The hologram faded. The clubroom returned to normal.
Rias was gripping the Evil Piece tight. She realized now why he refused. A Pawn promotion was too small for someone aiming to become a God of Destruction.
Ariel: "I showed you this because I'm done hiding. I'm going to train to reach these heights. And..."
He looked at Issei, Kiba, Koneko, and Asia.
Ariel: "...I'm unlocking the Library. You don't have to be human to learn these arts."
 * "Issei: I can teach you Ki Control to stop leaking your Dragon power."
 * "Kiba: I can teach you Observation to see the future."
 * "Koneko: I can teach you Armament to become unbreakable."
 * "Rias: I can teach you Destruction Theory from the God of Destruction himself."
Ariel: "Class is in session. Who wants to enroll?"
Issei stepped forward first, grinning.
Issei: "Teach me the Ki thing. I wanna shoot a beam like that Goku guy!"
Kiba bowed low. "If I can learn to cut like that... I am in."
Rias put the Evil Piece away. She smiled, a look of pure relief and excitement on her face.
Rias: "We accept, Sensei. Show us the path to the Sky."
[The Veritas Dojo was open. And the DxD World would never be the same.]
This concludes the Remastered Demo. It fixes the plot holes, integrates the full list of inspirations, and provides a satisfying, high-stakes climax that transitions perfectly into a future series.

## 2. The Current Grind: The Ocean of Will (One Piece)
Ariel swiped his hand. The gritty military scenes of Metal Gear vanished. The room was suddenly filled with the sound of crashing waves and the cry of seagulls.
A massive holographic map appeared—The Grand Line.
Ariel: "This is the reality I am currently living in. This is where I learned how to touch the untouchable."
He raised three fingers.
Ariel: "In this world, there are no spells. There is only Haki. It is the power to turn your Will into a physical force. There are three colors."
A. Armament (Busoshoku): The Armor & The Nullifier
The screen zoomed in on a chaotic battlefield.
 * Visual: A man made entirely of Smoke was fighting. Swords passed through him. Bullets drifted harmlessly through his chest. He was a Logia Type—a human turned into an element.
 * The Counter: A dark-skinned warrior stepped forward. His fist turned shiny, metallic black. He punched the Smoke man. CRACK. The smoke solidified. The man bled.
Ariel: "This is Armament. In this world, people eat 'Devil Fruits' that turn them into Fire, Magma, Light, or Smoke. Physical attacks cannot hurt them. Magic passes through them."
He looked at Riser's data on a side screen.
Ariel: "Riser turns into Fire to regenerate. To you, that's magic. To me, he is just a Logia type. If I coat my fist in my Will—my Armament—I force his 'Fire' body to become 'Solid' again. That is how I grabbed his flame. I didn't put it out; I forced it to be tangible."
The scene shifted rapidly, showing high-level counters to "Cheat" abilities.
 * Visual 1: A surgeon (Trafalgar Law) created a blue dome ("ROOM") where he controlled all space. He tried to teleport a massive Emperor (Kaido). The teleportation failed because the Emperor's Will was too dense.
 * Visual 2: A warden (Magellan) unleashed a hydra of purple, melting poison. A warrior blocked it with an invisible aura, the poison sliding off without touching the skin.
 * Visual 3: An Admiral (Akainu) rained magma that boiled the sea. A one-armed man (Shanks) stopped the magma punch with a single sword, his Will neutralizing the heat instantly.
Ariel: "This is the ultimate use. Nullification. Invincibility, Immortality, Teleportation, Instant Death Poison... they are all just systems. If your Will is harder than the system, you can deny it. That is how I stopped Riser’s healing. I imposed my Will: 'You are not immortal today.'"
Koneko stared at the screen, mesmerized. "Absolute defense... against anything."
B. Observation (Kenbunshoku): The Future Sight
The screen shifted to a dense jungle.
 * Visual: An old man with glasses (Silvers Rayleigh) stood blindfolded. A giant elephant swung a trunk at him. The old man didn't move until the last millisecond, dodging with a smile.
Ariel: "This is Observation. The ability to hear the 'Voice' of a living thing. The Intent."
The scene changed to a mirror dimension.
 * Visual: A man with a scarf (Katakuri) fighting a rubber man (Luffy). Katakuri’s eyes glowed red. He wasn't just dodging; he was reshaping his body around punches that hadn't been thrown yet.
Ariel: "At the highest level, you don't just sense danger. You see the Future. You see the attack 5 seconds before it happens. This is the wall I am climbing now. During the church fight, I felt Raynare's intent. But these men? They live in the future."
Kiba gripped his sword. "To see the future... that is the ultimate advantage."
C. Conqueror's (Haoshoku): The Authority
The music in the simulation changed. It became heavy, drum-like, terrifying.
The screen showed the Legends.
 * Rocks D. Xebec.
 * Gol D. Roger.
 * Edward Newgate (Whitebeard).
 * Monkey D. Garp.
 * Sengoku.
 * Kaido & Big Mom.
Ariel: "And this... is the King's Haki. Conqueror's."
 * Visual: Roger and Whitebeard clashed weapons. Their blades did not touch. A sphere of black lightning crackled between them. The sky above them split in half. The clouds were blown away by sheer pressure.
Ariel: "They don't just coat themselves in armor. They coat their attacks in Authority. They impose their domination on the world itself. When they strike, they don't just damage the body; they crush the spirit. They debuff the opponent’s will to fight."
He pointed to Garp, a Marine with no weapon, throwing a cannonball like a baseball.
Ariel: "Garp the Fist. He has no fruit. No magic. No sword. He stood equal to men who could destroy the world just by using his Haki—his Will. That is my hero."
Ariel turned off the projection of the Grand Line. The afterimage of the splitting sky lingered in the clubroom.
Ariel: "To those legends, what I did against Riser—stopping a fireball—is Basic. It is the entry-level requirement to survive in their ocean. That is why I cannot rest, Rias. I am still a novice compared to them."
He looked at the Peerage, his eyes burning with the reflection of the Pirate Kings.
Ariel: "But if we train... if we harden our Wills... we can turn our bodies into weapons that even Gods cannot break."

## C. Conqueror's (Haoshoku): The Pantheon of Authority
The holographic map of the Grand Line dissolved, replaced by a swirling, chaotic void of black and red lightning. The sound in the room changed—a low, vibrating hum that rattled the teacups on the table. It was the sound of King's Haki.
Ariel: "Armament defends. Observation predicts. But the final color... Conqueror's... dominates."
He swept his hand across the air. "I cannot teach you this. You are born with it. But I can show you what happens when a human decides they are greater than the world."
Huge, life-sized projections of the Legends materialized around the Gremory Peerage, freezing in moments of their greatest power.
1. The Rivals: Roger & Newgate (The Sky Split)
Two titans stood in the center. On the left, a man with a mustache and a red coat (Gol D. Roger). On the right, a giant of a man with a white crescent mustache (Edward Newgate / Whitebeard).
Ariel: "Watch the collision. No magic circles. No spells."
The projection moved. Roger leaped forward with his sword, Ace. Whitebeard swung his glaive, Murakumogiri.
They wrapped their weapons in jagged, black lightning.
They swung.
CRACK-BOOM.
The weapons did not touch. A sphere of pure force exploded between them.
The camera panned up. The clouds above the island didn't just part; they split, rolling back for miles, terrified of the clash below.
Ariel: "They hit the air so hard the atmosphere broke. Whitebeard (Newgate) had the power to destroy the world with vibrations, but he didn't use it here. He used only his Will. He matched the Pirate King with sheer presence."
2. The Hero: Monkey D. Garp (The Galaxy Impact)
The scene shifted to a island hive (Hachinosu). A ship flew through the air. Standing on the figurehead was an old Marine with broad shoulders and white hair.
Monkey D. Garp.
Ariel: "This is my ultimate inspiration. Look at him. No sword. No fruit. Just a fist."
Garp leaped from the ship. He cocked his fist back. The black lightning coated his hand, expanding into a massive aura.
He punched the town square. He didn't touch the ground; he punched the space above it.
"GALAXY IMPACT!"
A mushroom cloud of shockwaves flattened the town. Buildings crumbled into dust. The skull rock in the center of the island shattered.
Issei: "He... he nuked the town with a punch?!"
Ariel: "He calls it the 'Iron Fist of Love.' He destroyed a city block with air pressure and Haki. That is the pinnacle of PHY combined with SPR. That is what I am trying to turn my body into."
3. The Buddha: Sengoku (The Golden Shockwave)
Next to Garp appeared a man transforming into a giant, golden statue (Sengoku).
He didn't punch. He thrust his palm forward. A visible ripple of concussion blasted out, matching the power of the Quake fruit.
Ariel: "Sengoku the Buddha. He represents Wisdom and Impact. He converts his Authority into shockwaves that repel all evil. When he strikes, he doesn't just damage the body; he rejects the opponent's ideology."
4. The Taboo: Rocks D. Xebec (The Ambition)
The lighting dimmed. A silhouette appeared—wild hair, a manic grin, radiating an aura so dark it felt sticky. He stood alone against both Garp and Roger.
Rocks D. Xebec.
Ariel: "The man who wanted to be King of the World. His ambition was so great it took the Hero (Garp) and the King (Roger) working together to stop him. He represents Taboo Ambition. He didn't care about balance; he wanted to own it all. His Haki was a black hole that swallowed light."
5. The Natural Disasters: Kaido & Big Mom (Indestructibility)
The projection shifted to the roof of a skull dome.
A massive, horned beast-man (Kaido) swung a kanabo club. A giant woman riding a storm cloud (Big Mom) swung a living sword.
 * Kaido: He took a massive attack, shrugged it off, and swung his club using "Thunder Bagua." A master samurai was speed-blitzed and knocked unconscious in one hit.
 * Big Mom: She screamed. Her voice alone destroyed missiles and cracked mirrors. She combined lightning and fire into a localized catastrophe.
Ariel: "These two are Natural Disasters. They coat themselves in Conqueror's Haki permanently. Their skin is harder than steel. Conventional weapons break on contact. They don't dodge because they don't believe you can hurt them."
Koneko watched Kaido intensely. "To be so tough you don't need to block... that is the ultimate Rook."
6. The Golden Lion: Shiki (Control)
Finally, a man with a steering wheel in his head and swords for legs floated into view. He touched a battleship, and the battleship began to float. He touched the ground, and the earth turned into lion heads.
Shiki the Golden Lion.
Ariel: "Shiki. He represents Control. He could levitate islands. He fought Garp and Sengoku simultaneously and destroyed half of Marineford before he fell. His Will allowed him to command the environment itself."
The Lesson
Ariel deactivated the PTD. The giants faded, leaving the Gremory Peerage standing in the quiet clubroom, feeling very small.
Ariel: "Riser Phenex thinks he is a god because he can regenerate. But if Garp hit him? Riser would be vaporized before he could heal. If Roger swung his sword? Riser's fire would be blown out by the wind pressure."
Ariel looked at his hands—scarred, burned, but healing.
Ariel: "These are the benchmarks. The DxD world relies on Sacred Gears and Magic Formulas. The World of One Piece relies on Guts. That is why I study them. Because if I can learn to punch like Garp... I don't need a Longinus to kill a God."
He turned to Issei.
Ariel: "Issei. The Red Dragon Emperor is strong. But imagine if the Dragon had Haki. Imagine if your Boosted Gear was coated in the same black lightning as Roger's sword."
Issei gulped, his imagination firing. "I... I would be unstoppable."
Ariel: "Exactly. Class dismissed. Tomorrow, we start hitting things until they break."

## ➕ Phase 4 (Part 3): The Shadow and The Fear (Missing Link)
Ariel waved his hand, dismissing the giants of the Grand Line. The room darkened further. The atmosphere shifted from "Epic" to "Psychological Horror."
Ariel: "You see the power. But you don't see the cost. To hold that kind of Will, you have to conquer the thing living inside you."
1. The Inner Beast: Aku no Higan (Beyond Evil)
A holographic screen appeared, showing a man in a suit fighting a distorted, shadowy version of himself inside a mirror dimension.
Viktor (The Cleaner).
Ariel: "Before I could fight Riser, I had to fight Me. In Aku no Higan, power comes from diving into your own subconscious and making a contract with your 'Monstrous Self.'"
He looked at Issei.
Ariel: "Issei, you fear the Dragon inside you. You think it will eat you. I had a monster too—Envy. The voice that told me to hate you. The voice that wanted to steal your happiness. I didn't kill it. I Accepted it. I made it my engine."
Ariel: "True strength isn't being a 'Good Guy.' It's knowing you have a monster on a leash and choosing where to point it. That is why I am Fearless. I have already met the worst thing in the universe, and it was my own reflection."
2. The Art of Fear: Nurarihyon no Mago
The screen changed. It showed a young man transforming into a Yokai Lord with long, gravity-defying hair, drinking sake under a cherry blossom tree while surrounded by a hundred demons.
Nura Rikuo (Night Form).
Ariel: "And then there is Style. In the world of Nurarihyon, power is defined by 'Fear' (Osore). It is the ability to make your existence so undeniable that the enemy unknowingly submits."
Ariel demonstrated. He didn't flare energy. He just shifted his posture. The air in the clubroom grew heavy, thick, and distorted—an echo of the pressure he used to make Riser kneel.
Ariel: "This is 'The Weight of the Lord.' Riser used fire to scare you. I used Presence. If you carry yourself like the Master of Pandemonium, even a King will hesitate to strike you. It is the art of cutting the enemy's 'Fear' while imposing your own."
3. The Mad Dog: Return of the Crazy Demon
Finally, a screen flashed showing a man laughing maniacally while fighting an army, his eyes wild but his movements precise.
Yi Zaha (The Crazy Demon).
Ariel: "And sometimes... you just have to be crazy."
He grinned—a wild, fierce grin that looked uncomfortably like the man on the screen.
Ariel: "The Crazy Demon taught me that logic has limits. When you are a human fighting an Immortal Phoenix, logic says 'Run.' Madness says 'Punch him in the face.' To win against the supernatural, you have to be willing to break the world's logic. You have to be the glitch."
📜 The Complete "Veritas Vacation" Demo Summary
With this addition, the Demo Arc is complete and cohesive. Here is the final summary of what this Pilot Episode established:
 * The Protagonist: Ariel Caelum Veritas. A "Variable" who uses human potential and multiverse knowledge to defy supernatural physics.
 * The Conflict: Overcoming "Inferiority" (The Pervert/Background Character mindset) to become a "Legend."
 * The Methodology: The PTD (Personal Training Dossier) allowing him to simulate and learn from:
   * Tactics: MGS / Mercenary Enrollment (Survival).
   * Will/Haki: One Piece (Defense/Prediction).
   * Psychology: Aku no Higan / Nurarihyon (Inner Control/Fear).
   * Destruction: Gosu / Dragon Ball (The Ultimate Goal).
 * The Climax: Ariel physically dismantling Riser Phenex (Scenario B - Sore Loser) to protect Issei, proving his theories work.
 * The Ending: The Veritas Revelation. Ariel reveals the "Library of Legends" to the Gremory Peerage, rejecting the Evil Piece to remain human, and opening the Veritas Dojo to train them.
This is a solid foundation for a long-running series. The "Demo" is wrapped.

## ➕ Phase 4 (Part 1.5): The Human Apex (The Missing Link)
Ariel gestured to the screens showing the soldiers.
Ariel: "Being a soldier taught me discipline. But discipline isn't enough when a Priest is trying to cut your head off with a light sword. To survive that, I had to learn how to be Weak."
He swiped the screen. The images shifted to high school settings, but the violence was visceral.
1. The Dirty Fighter: Weak Hero (Gray Yeon)
A screen showed a slender, frail-looking boy (Gray Yeon) fighting a thug twice his size. He didn't punch; he threw a soda can, used a curtain to blind the enemy, and smashed a knee with a textbook.
Ariel: "You saw me use flour bombs and lubricants in the Church. You thought it was just 'Tactics.' It wasn't. It was Survival Philosophy."
He pointed to Gray.
Ariel: "Weak Hero. Gray Yeon taught me that when you are the weakest person in the room, Everything is a Weapon. Honor is a luxury for the strong. If I have to throw sand in Riser's eyes or blow up a water tower to win, I will. That is how a Human kills a Monster."
2. The Relativity of Time: The Boxer (Yu)
The screen changed. It showed a boxer in a ring (Yu). His opponent was throwing a lightning-fast jab. To the audience, it was a blur.
To Yu, the world had stopped. He watched the muscle fibers in his opponent's shoulder twitch. He watched the sweat fly in slow motion. He dodged effortlessly.
Ariel: "And before I learned Haki, I had to learn Time. Kiba, you asked how I tracked your speed."
Kiba: "Yes. Even without magic, your eyes followed me."
Ariel: "It’s not magic. It’s Processing Speed. In The Boxer, Yu lives in a world of stillness because his brain processes visual information faster than reality happens. I trained my eyes to see the 'Start' of the movement, not the 'End.' To me... you aren't fast. You're just moving while everyone else is waiting."
3. The Adaptation: The Heavenly Demon (Roman Dmitry)
Finally, a screen showed a man in medieval armor wielding a sword with cultivation energy (Roman Dmitry from The Heavenly Demon Can't Live a Normal Life).
Ariel: "And finally... Adaptation. Roman Dmitry was a Murim master reincarnated into a world of Magic. He didn't use their magic system; he forced his internal 'Ki' to dominate their Mana."
Ariel clenched his fist, showing the faint aura of his Iron Body.
Ariel: "This world runs on Demonic Power and Sacred Gears. I don't have those. So like the Heavenly Demon, I am forcing my Human Will to act as a substitute. I am overwriting the laws of DxD with the laws of my Library."
📜 Final Note
With these final pieces, the Library of Legends is complete. Ariel has fully explained his origin:
 * Soldier/Weak Hero: Survival & Dirty Tactics.
 * Boxer/Manhwa: Physical & Sensory Limits.
 * One Piece: Willpower & Supernatural Counter.
 * Psychological: Controlling the Inner Beast.
 * Dragon Ball/Gosu: The Ultimate Goal of Destruction.
The "Veritas Vacation" Demo is now a complete, cohesive narrative package. Thank you for this incredible co-writing session. The journey of the Mortal Variable has been forged.

## 🌌 Final Chapter: The Library of the Mortal Variable
Timeline: Post-Riser Victory (The "Sore Loser" Aftermath).
Location: Occult Research Clubroom (Ruined).
1. The Silence After the Storm
The golden fire of Riser’s cage had faded. Sirzechs Lucifer had departed with the broken Phenex.
The room was silent, save for the settling dust.
Issei was awake now, sitting up on the couch, staring at Ariel with wide eyes. Rias, Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko stood in a semi-circle, their expressions a mix of gratitude and profound unease.
Ariel sat on a folding chair, wrapping a fresh bandage around his blackened, burned hand.
Rias: "Ariel-kun."
Ariel didn't look up. "Kaichou."
Rias: "You stopped an Immortal's regeneration. You punched fire. You terrified my brother, the Satan. I cannot accept 'I'm just a human' as an answer anymore. What are you?"
Ariel tied off the bandage. He looked at his friends.
He saw Kiba gripping his sword, desperate to know the secret of that speed.
He saw Koneko staring at his skin, wondering how it became steel.
He saw Issei, looking at him like he was a superhero.
Ariel: "I'm not a superhero, Issei. And I'm not a Monster, Rias."
He stood up, wincing slightly as his healed leg took his weight.
Ariel: "I'm a Student. But I don't study math or history."
He walked to the center of the room.
Ariel: "System. Archive: The Library of Legends. Full Projection. Authorization: Veritas."
2. Tier 1: The Foundation (Survival)
The room dissolved. The PTD overrode reality, filling the air with floating screens showing gritty, realistic battlefields.
Ariel: "Before I could fight magic, I had to learn how to not die. I learned from the Soldiers."
He pointed to screens showing Solid Snake, Kang Chan (God of Blackfield), and Ijin Yu (Mercenary Enrollment).
Ariel: "They taught me CQC and Efficiency. How to disarm a stronger opponent. How to snap a joint."
The screen shifted to a boy fighting a thug with a soda can (Gray Yeon - Weak Hero).
Ariel: "And him. Gray Yeon. He taught me that when you are the weakest person in the room, Everything is a Weapon. Honor is a luxury. That’s why I used flour bombs in the church. That’s why I used the water tower against Riser. It wasn't magic. It was dirty, desperate physics."
3. Tier 2: The Human Apex (Perception)
Ariel swiped his hand. The images changed to athletes and martial artists moving with impossible grace.
Kiba: "Your speed... how did you track me?"
Ariel pointed to a boxer in a ring (Yu - The Boxer). The world around the boxer was moving in slow motion.
Ariel: "It's not speed, Kiba. It's Time Perception. Yu taught me to process visual information faster than reality happens. I don't see your sword swinging; I see the muscle twitch that starts the swing."
He pointed to a man adapting to a magical world (Roman Dmitry - Heavenly Demon).
Ariel: "And Adaptation. Like the Heavenly Demon, I force my internal system to overwrite yours. I refuse to play by Devil rules."
4. Tier 3: The Ocean of Will (Defense & Nullification)
The room filled with the sound of crashing waves. The Grand Line appeared.
Ariel: "This is the core. The Will. In this world, it is called Haki."
The Iron Wall:
Images of Vergo and Monkey D. Garp appeared. Their skin turned shiny, black, and metallic. Garp punched a mountain, shattering it without magic.
Ariel: "This is Armament. Coating the body in Spirit. This is how I punched the fire. I didn't put it out; I made my skin denser than the flame."
The Future Sight:
Images of Rayleigh and Katakuri appeared.
Ariel: "This is Observation. Sensing the 'Intent' of a living thing. Sensing the future."
The Nullifier:
An image of Scopper Gaban smashing a divine shield appeared.
Ariel: "And this... is Nullification. Scopper Gaban. He taught me that 'Invincibility' and 'Immortality' are just systems. If your Will is harder than the system, you can break it. That is how I stopped Riser’s healing. I imposed my Will: 'You are mortal today.'"
5. Tier 4: The Psychology (Fear)
The room darkened. The atmosphere became heavy, thick, and suffocating.
Shadowy figures appeared. Viktor (Beyond Evil), Nura Rikuo (Nurarihyon), and Yi Zaha (Crazy Demon).
Ariel: "You asked why I wasn't scared of Riser's aura. It's because I study Fear."
He pointed to Nura Rikuo.
Ariel: "The Master of Pandemonium. He taught me 'The Weight of the Lord.' How to make your existence so undeniable that the enemy kneels without being touched."
He pointed to Viktor.
Ariel: "And him. He taught me to dive into my own subconscious and leash the monster inside. My Jealousy. My Envy. I don't hide them. I use them as fuel. That is why I am Fearless."
6. Tier 5: The Aspirations (Dominance)
Two titans appeared. Aizen Sousuke (Bleach) stopping a sword with a finger. Acnologia (Fairy Tail) ripping the sky.
Ariel: "These are the Variables. The ones who stand alone. Aizen stops swords with pressure. Acnologia ends wars by being the third side. That is what I want to be for you, Rias. Not a Pawn. But the Third Side that protects you."
7. Tier 6: The Heavens (The Ultimate Goal)
Finally, the center screen expanded. It eclipsed everything else.
 * Dokgo Ryong (Gosu) waving his hand and erasing a mountain range.
 * Goku (Dragon Ball Super) moving in Ultra Instinct.
 * Beerus (Dragon Ball Super) erasing a planet with a tap.
The Peerage stared in silence. The scale of power was beyond comprehension.
Ariel: "And this... is the Sky (Caelum). The Heavenly Destroyer. The Gods of Destruction. They don't fight. They Erase. They exist in a state of perfection where thought and action are one."
Ariel turned to the Peerage. He looked small against the backdrop of these cosmic giants, but his eyes were fierce.
Ariel: "I am currently at the level of a Soldier. I am reaching for the level of a Pirate. But one day... I want to stand there."
He pointed at Beerus.
Ariel: "I want to be the Mortal who walked into the realm of Gods through pushups and stubbornness. That is my Truth."
8. The Invitation
The hologram faded. The clubroom returned to normal.
Rias was gripping the Evil Piece tight. She finally understood. A Pawn promotion was too small for someone aiming to become a God of Destruction.
Rias: "You... you are a greedy human, Ariel Veritas."
Ariel: "Ambition is free, Kaichou."
Ariel looked at his friends. Issei, Kiba, Koneko, Asia.
Ariel: "I'm unlocking the Library. You don't have to be human to learn these arts."
 * "Issei: I can teach you Ki Control to stop leaking your Dragon power."
 * "Kiba: I can teach you Time Perception to see the start of the blade."
 * "Koneko: I can teach you Armament to become the Unbreakable Rook."
 * "Rias: I can teach you Destruction Theory from the God of Destruction himself."
Ariel: "Class is in session. Who wants to enroll?"
Issei stepped forward first, grinning wildy.
Issei: "Teach me how to punch a mountain like that Garp guy!"
Kiba bowed low. "To cut the intent... yes. I am in."
Koneko cracked her knuckles. "I want the black armor."
Rias put the Evil Piece away. She smiled, a look of pure relief and excitement on her face.
Rias: "We accept, Sensei. Show us the path to the Sky."
[The Veritas Dojo was open. The Mortal Variable had arrived.]
[End of Demo]
