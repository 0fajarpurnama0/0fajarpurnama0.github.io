Changing the domain name server (DNS) is one of the easiest way. If the contents restriction is by DNS we simply only need to use another DNS, if not then this method cannot be use. Here will be introduced of DNS on public level in other words simple term, for detailed about DNS you can visit (or will be) my other site www.0darkking0.wordpress.com.

To make things short we browse the web mainly using the domain address for example "www.facebook.com", but our machine itself prefer  internet protocol (IP) address which is still version 4 of IP "173.252.74.22". When we write, the DNS translate it from "www.facebook.com" &gt; "173.252.74.22".
