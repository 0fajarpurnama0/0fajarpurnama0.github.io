![BitTube Monetization]({{ '/assets/images/reward-browser/BitTube-Monetize.PNG' | relative_url }})

### BitTube.TV {#bittubetv}
A decentralized social media and video platform that uploads your video to IPFS to make it censorship resistance (I think at their own server as well). However not entirely resistant for the site. Their site simply list videos from IPFS for example, they will delist videos that violates ToS or requested but your video will still remain in IPFS.

## <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icon/CryptoTab-Browser.png' | relative_url }}" style="max-width:1.3em;height:1.3em;" alt="CryptoTab Browser icon."> CryptoTab Browser {#cryptotab-browser}
Well if you want to mine using your computer directly, you can use this browser on Windows or MacOS: [https://cryptotabbrowser.com/landing/67/2016839/?p=spring21](https://cryptotabbrowser.com/landing/67/2016839/?p=spring21).

Cryptotab Browser is a fork of Chrome browser with a CPU javascript miner built. In other words all the browsing features are based on chrome with an additional feature to mine and earn bitcoin (BTC). Browse casually such as searching in Google, watching movies in Youtube, interract in Facebook and Twitter, while mining.

Maybe the following reasons why beginners are reluctant in owning bitcoins:

- Traditionally, a person needs to find another person who owns bitcoin to get.
- It's usually easy to get bitcoin in exchanges, but nowadays you need "know your customer" (KYC) where you to upload your identification documents first before you can buy, and worse some requires proof of address.
- A popular way to get bitcoin is through mining but setting up mining the usually way is difficult for average users.

![Cryptotab Browser screenshot showing that it is mining bitcoin at 100 H/s at a click of a button.]({{ '/assets/images/reward-browser/Cryptotab-CPU-Mining.png' | relative_url }})

### Multi-level Referal System {#cryptotab-multi-level-referral-system}

Their referral system is also one of the best. They applied multi-level marketing where not only you will get a lifetime commission for inviting someone, but you will also get a commission the person you invited invites someone.

![Cryptotab Browser screenshot of referral system from their page, basically like the explanation above.]({{ '/assets/images/reward-browser/Cryptotab-MLR.png' | relative_url }})

### Installing {#cryptotab-installing}
Cryptotab Browser is suited for anyone who wants to start owning bitcoin. The setup process is easier compared to the usual mining process.

### Cryptotab Browser Mobile {#cryptotab-mobile}
Cryptotab Browser is also available on playstore and applestore. Download using the same link: [https://cryptotabbrowser.com/landing/67/2016839/?p=spring21](https://cryptotabbrowser.com/landing/67/2016839/?p=spring21)

![Cryptotab Browser on Samsung A7.]({{ '/assets/images/reward-browser/Cryptotab-Browser-Mobile.png' | relative_url }})
Update: now the app does not mine on your smartphone but server dependent mining which in my opinion is free cloud mining. Buy the pro version for faster mining where you have to boost every 3 hours.

### Withdrawing {#cryptotab-withdrawing}
I have mined for a while and succeeded in withdrawing bitcoin to both my exchange wallet and personal wallet, also that I've tried withdrawing from both PC and Smarphone version of the software. It works, meaning that it is legitimate.
