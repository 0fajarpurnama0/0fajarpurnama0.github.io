As a businessman, entrepreneur, or investor it is important to know of how to find deals, how to evaluate deals, how to make deals, and how to seal deals. Looking from certain lenses, going to school can also be seen as a deal. Here I will state my deals perspective of going to school based on different variables and evaluated in likert scale.

## Finance

School can either cost or pay you.

1.  **Student loan** is the **worst deal**. To study, you need to be in bad debt.
2.  **Expensive cost** is a **bad deal**. It cost you a lot of money to study.
3.  **Affordable cost** is an **okay deal**. Most people are here.
4.  **Conditional scholarship** is a **good deal**. Eventhough you have to work for few years afterwards but you are still paid during both studying and working.
5.  **Unconditional scholarship** is the **best deal**. You get paid for studying and you are free after that.

## Freedom

If you are forced to go to school or chose the wrong field, you need free time to do your passion.

1.  **Enslavement** is the **worst deal**. You are exploited to do this and to do that for example, you are being treated as a paper machine.
2.  **Busy** is a **bad deal**. You barely have enough time for yourself, when are you going to start doing what you want to do?
3.  **Balance** is an **okay deal**. Put just enough effort to finish school but do what you are passionate about on your free time.
4.  **Leisure** is a **good deal**. You will have the time to do your passion or main goal, don't waste it.
5.  **Freedom** is the **best deal**. This happens during my PhD, I am in charge of my own schedule of when I should work and when I should not and only obligated to report every week and I performed well with minimum effort while the rest of the time I used them to catch up with the history of the world, the economy, news, and learn what I am passionate about such as investing.

## Passion

1.  **Being forced** to school is the **worst deal**. Almost all the time being forced never turns right or at the very least a bad affect in the long run.
2.  Want to go to school but found out later that the field **doesn't suit** is a **bad deal**. Quickly change or get out.
3.  The school is **below your expectation** is an **okay deal**.
4.  The school is **in line with your passion** is a **good deal**.
5.  The school is **beyond your expectation** is the **best deal**.

## Education Quality

Straightforwardly:

1.  Worst quality = worst deal.
2.  Bad quality = bad deal.
3.  Okay quality = okay deal.
4.  Good quality = good deal.
5.  Best quality = best deal.

## Social Network

If the school is:

1.  Filled with **hostile students** is the **worst deal**. If you can convert them into friends is a great thing, great skill to learn, great experience but very risky because they can destroy you.
2.  Filled with **unsocial students** **doesn't suit** is a bad deal. It means nothing if you can't befriend them.
3.  Filled with **friendly students** is an **okay deal**. Why you should go to school instead of homeschooling is to make friends.
4.  Filled with **achieving students** is a **good deal**. They are potentially great partners in the future.
5.  Filled with **friendly achieving students** is the **best deal**. Less effort to find great partners.
