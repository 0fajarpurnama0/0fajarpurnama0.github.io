## My Description and Opinion

![0.featured-image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUuaq7jM2cqxy7nLkdebnStZKDxGJnwvzYhy8CtWb4Yk7/0.featured-image.png)

Real estate business is a rich man's or woman's business now. With the average salary in my area of around $200 a month it will take almost 6 years to accumulate that salary to be able to buy a cheap land which is $14500 and in reality will take even more years as the previous calculation do not include the expenses. Building a home will cost at least another same amount, it can be much more, so how many years for anyone starting from zero to afford a house? Just excluding the expenses, it will take at fastest 12 years. This is the unfortunate fate of average people who are not exposed to banking services. Those who are fortunate can apply for credits or loans where they can immediately own a house but must cut their salary every month. Businessman and entrepreneur knows how to utilize the system. They can borrow money to buy a land or property but do business with them. For example, the trend in my area is building a motel, guess house, or any kind of renting services where the profit can be much more than the amount of interest they need to pay each month.

The old timers said that this was not the case in the past. Just work hard and eventually anyone can afford a property. I do not know why, maybe because of inflation or people doing property business where they keep on buying and selling repeatedly, the price skyrocketed. Maybe because the minority finally got their hands on most of the properties which can be almost a monopoly so they can just set the price high. In the end, we Millenials and GenerationZ have no almost no hope in finding properties with decent price so might as well bury the idea of business in real estate. Well, we can still dream by playing Monopoly video games such as "Get Rich" but being rich there is only being rich there. However [Upland](https://r.upland.me/NAts) plans to bring the real economy into the game that if we profit we will really become rich not only inside the game but in real life as well because they plan to have the in-game currency and other assets to be tradeable to real world physical asset.

While I did skim through their website, social medias, and whitepaper, what I will be writing here will only be purely based on my experience in trying Upland mixed with my opinion. Simply I saw Upland as an Earth Metaverse which is a virtual reality based on the real earth where we can do real estate business in this digital universe. Here, we can experience digitally of being a real estate entrepreneur where we buy virtual real estate for a profit and become virtual land owners. Thanks to cryptocurrencies, digital value can be converted into physical value and other than that, the team also plans to connect fiat payment directly.

Still, if the developers quit, wouldn't Upland just vanishes? Upland is a decentralized application (dapp) currently on the EOS blockchain. If the developers quit, others can easily take their place and run the dapp. What about our assets? They are all recorded on the EOS blockchain and far in the future they may integrate with other blockchains. We can find the whitepaper, social media, and blog on their website but I was curious about the token which I cannot search on EOS block explorer. Eventually, I found [https://dappradar.com/eos/games/upland](https://dappradar.com/eos/games/upland) and found the two smartcontracts:

*   [https://bloks.io/account/playuplandme](https://bloks.io/account/playuplandme)
*   [https://bloks.io/tokens/UPX-eos-upxtokenacct](https://bloks.io/tokens/UPX-eos-upxtokenacct)

![4.property-bought.PNG](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdZLcvvd159tHbMuo1eNEWpGGgszAtDfu2tmrYwZ8H4Xs/4.property-bought.PNG)

Now, how do I see the profit of Upland? Ofcourse there are many strategies including the default real estate strategy about finding undervalued potential famous places, but my opinion is closer to web domain investing. I think that people in the real world will one day want to own a counterpart of their properties in Upland. The first properties I'd hunt are real life property owners who are pro cryptos. They have higher probability of finding Upland and will want to own the same properties in Upland as the ones in real life. I forsee in the future that Upland properties can serve as a marketing to real life properties. For example, purchasing a physical property will get a bonus of the counterpart property in Upland or an even more crazy example that Upland purchases can represent real life physical purchases.

## What New Players Today May Confuse About

![5.different-colors.PNG](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWsLMe7og19skJ9Kdi7KcvBS9B42RbbGHcnCm1xyWZ6mU/5.different-colors.PNG)

In the [guide from the website](https://upland.me/how-to-guide-2/buying-selling-trading-properties) we can find what the color means on different tiles. While it is true that everything is written on the tutorial, maybe my understanding is bad that only permanent Uplanders with more than 10000 UPX net worth can buy the dark green tiles. New visitors can only buy the light green tiles. With the quote that "early birds gets the worms" applies here, today there are almost no light green tiles left. I do find very few light green tiles, but all of the are prices above 10000 UPX which is the same that we should just aim to become an Uplander straight away (note that we are initially visitors and if we forget to renew our VISA every few days, the assets we bought can be reset). As for me, I cannot proceed with anything after registering even with the signup bonus, so I purchase enough UPX with Bitcoin to upgrade my status to permanent Uplander.

*   After my UPX net worth became over 10000, I became a permanent Uplander and was given an [EOS account](https://bloks.io/account/cx11pphewntn) after binding my phone number.
*   Finally, I was able to buy my first property in Upland and the certificate is the [transaction ID on the EOS blockchain a2aefb6674b60f95e1dac73ab3ab56c37f5235652d180c0c5c11d71c61854865](https://bloks.io/transaction/a2aefb6674b60f95e1dac73ab3ab56c37f5235652d180c0c5c11d71c61854865).
