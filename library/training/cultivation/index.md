## Cultivation Notes

Here is the detailed breakdown of **Phase 1: The Twelve Standard Meridians**.

In traditional cultivation and martial arts medicine, the **12 Standard Meridians** are the rivers that carry energy (Qi/Ki) to the organs and limbs. The **8 Extraordinary Meridians** (which include the Microcosmic Orbit) are the reservoirs. You must clear the rivers (Phase 1) before you can fill the reservoirs (Phase 2).

### 📂 PTD Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 1 Manual

**Total Targets:** 12 Standard Meridians.
**Anatomy:** Each meridian corresponds to an organ and runs bilaterally (both sides of the body).
**Sensation Progression:**

1. **Numbness/Ants:** The nerves waking up. (Route 0 limit).
2. **Heat/Pressure:** The energy hitting a blockage.
3. **Needle Pain:** The energy drilling through the blockage.
4. **Cool Breeze/Liquid Flow:** The blockage is cleared.

### 🟢 Step 1: The Hand Taiyin & Yangming (The Breath & Grip)

*Priority: High. Essential for punching and weapon usage.*

**1. Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin**

* **Path:** Chest  Shoulder  Down inner arm  Thumb tip.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Chize* point (Elbow crease).
* **Effect of Clearing:** Increases respiratory efficiency (stamina) and thumb grip strength.
* **Drill:** Visualize white light. Inhale deep. Push the breath from the chest down to the thumb. When the thumb grows hot, the channel is open.

**2. Large Intestine Meridian of Hand-Yangming**

* **Path:** Index finger tip  Up outer arm  Shoulder  Neck  Face (Nose).
* **Blockage Point:** The *Hegu* point (Webbing between thumb and index finger).
* **Effect of Clearing:** Relieves tension in the arms/neck. Essential for "locking" joints in grappling.

### 🔵 Step 2: The Foot Yangming & Taiyin (The Root & Stance)

*Priority: High. Essential for stability and taking a hit.*

**3. Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming**

* **Path:** Face  Chest  Abdomen  Down outer leg  Second toe.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Zusanli* point (Below the knee).
* **Effect of Clearing:** "Iron Stomach" (Core durability). Massive boost to leg endurance. This is the "Runner's Meridian."

**4. Spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin**

* **Path:** Big toe  Up inner leg  Abdomen  Chest.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Sanyinjiao* point (Above the ankle).
* **Effect of Clearing:** Improves muscle tone and digestion (converting food to energy faster).

### 🔴 Step 3: The Hand Shaoyin & Taiyang (The Spirit & Speed)

*Priority: Medium. Essential for reaction time and adrenaline control.*

**5. Heart Meridian of Hand-Shaoyin**

* **Path:** Armpit  Down inner arm (pinky side)  Pinky tip.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Shaohai* point (Inner elbow).
* **Effect of Clearing:** Calms the mind (Combat Composure). Connects intention to the hand (Speed).

**6. Small Intestine Meridian of Hand-Taiyang**

* **Path:** Pinky tip  Up outer arm  Shoulder blade  Neck  Ear.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Houxi* point (Side of hand/fist).
* **Effect of Clearing:** Hardens the edge of the hand (Knife-hand strikes). Releases shoulder tension for faster swinging.

### 🟣 Step 4: The Foot Taiyang & Shaoyin (The Spine & Battery)

*Priority: Critical. This prepares the body for the Microcosmic Orbit.*

**7. Bladder Meridian of Foot-Taiyang** (The Longest Channel)

* **Path:** Inner Eye  Over Head  Down entire Spine  Down back of legs  Pinky toe.
* **Blockage Point:** The *Weizhong* point (Back of knee).
* **Effect of Clearing:** This is the primary "Yang" armor of the back. Clearing this allows you to carry heavy loads and resist knockdowns.

**8. Kidney Meridian of Foot-Shaoyin**

* **Path:** Sole of foot (*Yongquan*)  Up inner leg  Spine  Chest.
* **Blockage Point:** **The Yongquan (Bubbling Spring)** at the sole of the foot.
* **Effect of Clearing:** Connection to the earth. Infinite stamina intake from the ground. This is the source of **"Rooting"**.

### 🟠 Step 5: The Hand Jueyin & Shaoyang (The Shield & Coordinator)

**9. Pericardium Meridian of Hand-Jueyin**

* **Path:** Chest  Down middle of inner arm  Middle finger tip.
* **Effect of Clearing:** Protects the heart from shock (Physical/Emotional). Acts as a "Heat Sink" for excess energy.

**10. San Jiao (Triple Burner) Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang**

* **Path:** Ring finger  Up outer arm  Neck  Around Ear.
* **Effect of Clearing:** Regulates body temperature (Homeostasis). Allows the user to fight in extreme heat or cold (Void training prerequisite).

### 🟤 Step 6: The Foot Shaoyang & Jueyin (The Agility & Detox)

**11. Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang**

* **Path:** Eye  Side of Head  Down side of body/ribs  Down side of legs  Fourth toe.
* **Effect of Clearing:** "Gall" (Courage). Decision making speed. Side-to-side agility (dodging).

**12. Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin**

* **Path:** Big toe  Up inner leg  Groin  Ribs  Lung.
* **Effect of Clearing:** Detoxification. Explosive strength (Tendons). If this is blocked, you get cramps; if clear, you have "Spring-like" power.

### ⚡ The Clearing Protocol (The Grind)

**Daily Routine for Ariel/Ren (Before Phase 2):**
To clear a single meridian usually takes a normal cultivator months. With PTD (simulated time) and extreme focus, they do it in **clusters**.

1. **Warm Up:** Stretch the physical path of the meridian (e.g., stretch arms for Lung Channel).
2. **Visualization:** Visualize the line as a dried-up riverbed.
3. **The Flood:** Use **Reverse Breathing** to push the "Water" (Blood/Heat/Ki) into the riverbed.
4. **The Drill:** When the heat stops (Blockage), focus *all* mental attention on that millimeter of flesh. Pulse the muscle. Use the "Ants" sensation as a guide.
5. **The Breakthrough:** When the heat shoots past the point to the toes/fingers, the channel is **Open**.

**Completion State:**
When all 12 are clear, the user achieves **"Small Success" (Xiaocheng)**. They are physically perfect humans, ready to connect the reservoirs (The Dantians) in Phase 2.

Here is the detailed manual for **Phase 2: The Microcosmic Orbit (The Small Heavenly Circuit)**.

This is the most critical threshold in cultivation logic. Phase 1 (12 Meridians) makes you a **Peak Human**. Phase 2 (The Orbit) makes you a **Self-Sustaining Engine**, effectively granting infinite stamina relative to normal human output.

# 📂 Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 2 Manual

**Target:** The 8 Extraordinary Meridians (Specifically **Ren** and **Du**).
**Goal:** Create a closed-loop energy system to recycle waste energy and generate continuous power.

### 🧬 The Anatomy of the Orbit

Before engaging the flow, you must visualize the two great reservoirs of the body:

1. **The Du Mai (Governing Vessel):** The **Yang** ocean.
* **Path:** Runs up the spine, over the head, to the upper lip.
* **Function:** Hardness, aggression, heat, physical structure.


2. **The Ren Mai (Conception Vessel):** The **Yin** ocean.
* **Path:** Runs from the lower lip, down the throat and chest, to the perineum.
* **Function:** Softness, healing, cooling, organ regulation.

**The Disconnect:** In normal humans, these two channels are disconnected at the mouth and the hips. Energy stagnates.
**The Fix:** You must build the bridges to connect them.

### ⚡ The Circulation Protocol (Step-by-Step)

**Prerequisite:** All 12 Standard Meridians must be clear, or the pressure from the Orbit will rupture your smaller vessels (bleeding from eyes/nose).

#### Step 1: The Origin (Lower Dantian)

* **Action:** Focus on the Lower Dantian (3 inches below the navel).
* **Technique:** **Reverse Breathing**. Inhale, pulling the stomach *in*. Compress the energy into a dense, hot sphere.
* **Sensation:** A heavy, swirling warmth.

#### Step 2: The First Gate (Huiyin / Perineum)

* **Action:** Push the energy *down* to the absolute bottom of the torso (the perineum).
* **Challenge:** This is the "Pump." You must gently contract the pelvic floor muscles (Kegel) to push the energy past the gap and into the tailbone.
* **Visual:** Pushing water through a U-bend pipe.

#### Step 3: The Ascent of Fire (The Three Passes)

* **Action:** Move the energy **Up the Spine**. This is the Yang phase. It requires **Willpower**.
* **The Three Gates (Blockages):**
1. **Weilu (Tailbone):** Hard to enter. Requires a sharp push.
2. **Jiaji (Opposite the Heart):** The energy often scatters here due to emotion. Keep the mind empty.
3. **Yuzhen (Jade Pillow / Base of Skull):** The hardest gate. The skull is thick. You must "Drill" through this to reach the brain.

* **Sensation:** Intense heat rising up your back. Like hot water poured along the spine.

#### Step 4: The Summit (Baihui / Crown)

* **Action:** Push the energy to the very top of the head.
* **Effect:** The "Yang" energy meets the brain.
* **Sensation:** A sudden flash of light behind the eyelids. Mental clarity spikes to 200%. The "Heat" turns into "Vibration."

#### Step 5: The Magpie Bridge (The Switch)

* **Action:** Move the energy down to the roof of the mouth.
* **CRITICAL PHYSICAL ACTION:** **Touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth (behind the teeth).**
* **Why:** This physically connects the Du Meridian (Roof) to the Ren Meridian (Tongue). It acts as a circuit breaker.
* **Sensation:** A metallic taste or a sudden spark of "cool" liquid saliva (Golden Elixir). The energy instantly changes from Hot (Yang) to Cool (Yin).

#### Step 6: The Waterfall (Ren Mai)

* **Action:** Let the energy flow *down* the front of the throat, chest, and solar plexus.
* **Technique:** Do not push. **Relax.** Let gravity and the vacuum created by your empty Dantian pull it down.
* **Sensation:** A cool, refreshing waterfall washing over the heart and organs. This is the **Healing Phase**.

#### Step 7: The Return

* **Action:** The energy returns to the Lower Dantian.
* **Result:** The cycle is complete. The energy is not lost; it is refined. It is denser and easier to control than before.

### 🔮 Route Variances

#### **For Ariel (Route A / NG+): The Golden Cycle**

* **Visual:** His orbit looks like a ring of fire.
* **Focus:** He emphasizes the **Ascent (Spine)**. He pumps massive amounts of Yang energy to reinforce his bone density and muscle output.
* **Result:** His body temperature runs high (102°F). He burns calories instantly. He effectively has **Infinite Cardio**.

#### **For Ren (Route B / NG+): The Void Loop**

* **Visual:** His orbit looks like a black hole accretion disk.
* **Focus:** He emphasizes the **Descent (Front)**. He uses the cooling phase to absorb entropy and store it in the gut.
* **Result:** His body temperature runs low (90°F). He has **Infinite Calm**. He uses the cycle to digest the "foreign energy" he absorbs (like Riser's fire), breaking it down into raw fuel.

### ⚠️ Dangers: Qi Deviation (Zouhuo Rumou)

If you fail Step 5 (The Bridge) or lose focus at Step 3 (The Jade Pillow):

1. **Fire Entering the Head:** The hot energy gets stuck in the brain.
* *Symptoms:* Hallucinations, extreme aggression, stroke, madness.

2. **Stagnation:** The energy stops in the chest.
* *Symptoms:* Heart arrhythmia, panic attacks, shortness of breath.

**Safety Protocol:** If pain becomes sharp, immediately visualize the energy sinking into the ground through the feet (**Grounding**) to vent the pressure.

**Next Step:** Once the Orbit is stable (can cycle 36 times without focus), the user is ready for **Phase 3: The Dantians (Capacity Expansion)**.

You are absolutely right. If we strip away the "Sensor" aspect (which is a specialized function of the Upper Dantian), **Phase 3** is fundamentally about **Capacity and Density**.

Phase 1 built the roads (Meridians). Phase 2 built the flow (Orbit). **Phase 3 builds the Storage Tank.**

Without this phase, you are like a phone with a great processor but a battery that dies in 5 minutes. You can't fight long battles.

Here are the general steps for **Phase 3: The Three Treasures (Jing, Qi, Shen)** focusing on Power and Stamina.

# 📂 Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 2.5 Manual (The Valves)

**Goal:** To convert Internal Flow into External Phenomenon.
**Logic:** A pipe (Meridian) needs a nozzle (Chakra) to create pressure and direction.

### 👐 The Minor Chakras (The Tactical Gates)

*These are the most important for combat. They are located at the extremities.*

**1. The Hand Chakras (Laogong Points)**

* **Location:** Center of the palm.
* **Function:** **Emission & Manipulation.**
* *Naruto:* Rasengan / Chidori base.
* *Dragon Ball:* Ki Blasts.
* *Wuxia:* Imbuing weapons (Sword Qi).

* **Training:** Clap hands together hard until they sting. Separate them slightly. Push Ki *out* against the air pressure between palms.
* **Blockage Symptom:** Hot hands, but no projection.

**2. The Foot Chakras (Yongquan Points)**

* **Location:** The depression in the sole of the foot (just below the ball).
* **Function:** **Mobility & Rooting.**
* *Naruto:* Water Walking / Wall Walking.
* *Bleach:* Shunpo (Flash Step) traction.
* *Wuxia:* "Weight of a Mountain" stance.

* **Training:** Stand on one leg. Push energy down into the floor. Visualize "Roots" growing out of the sole.
* **Blockage Symptom:** Clumsy movement when using high speed; slipping.

**3. The Joint Chakras (Elbows/Knees/Shoulders)**

* **Function:** **Boosters.**
* *Application:* Releasing a burst of energy from the elbow to punch faster (Rocket Punch logic).
* *Ren's Application:* Venting "Void Smoke" to obscure vision.

# 📂 Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 3 (Capacity Expansion)

**Goal:** To stop "circulating" energy and start "compressing" it into a solid core.
**The Concept:** **Dan (Elixir/Pearl).** You want to turn your gas-like energy into liquid, and your liquid energy into a solid sphere.

### 🟢 Step 1: The Lower Dantian (The Fuel Tank)

*Focus: Vitality (Jing), Hardness, and Stamina.*

**1. The Anchor (Centering)**

* **Action:** Physical focus on the point 3 inches below the navel, deep inside the gut.
* **Visualization:** Imagine a heavy iron ball sitting in your pelvis.
* **The Drill:** Walk around. Try to keep your "mind" in your stomach, not your head. This lowers your center of gravity (Rooting).

**2. The Spiral (Accumulation)**

* **Action:** After running the Microcosmic Orbit (Phase 2), do not let the energy dissipate.
* **Technique:** Guide the flow into the Lower Dantian. Visualize it spinning **clockwise** (spiraling inward).
* **Logic:** Like winding a spring. The tighter you wind it, the more potential energy it holds.

**3. The Compression (Solidification)**

* **Action:** Use **Reverse Breathing** (Sucking the stomach in).
* **The Squeeze:** Every time you inhale, imagine the spiral getting smaller and denser.
* **Success State:** You feel a permanent "warm knot" in your stomach, even when you aren't meditating.
* *Combat Application:* This is where **Touki (Defense)** comes from. You flex your stomach, and the density radiates out to harden your skin.

### 🔵 Step 2: The Middle Dantian (The Combustion Chamber)

*Focus: Emotion (Qi), Breath, and Projection.*

**1. The Emotional Trigger**

* **Action:** Recall a strong emotion.
* *Issei:* Lust/Protectiveness.
* *Ren:* Envy/Cold Detachment.
* *Ariel:* Determination/Battle Thrill.

* **Technique:** Move the heat from the Lower Dantian up to the Chest (Heart level).

**2. The Transmutation (The Burn)**

* **Action:** Mix the "Fuel" (Lower Dantian energy) with the "Spark" (Emotion).
* **Visualization:** A furnace lighting up in your ribcage.
* **Sensation:** Your chest should feel hot and expansive, making you want to shout or punch.

**3. The Vent (Projection)**

* **Action:** This is the opposite of the Lower Dantian. Instead of compressing, you **Expand**.
* **Technique:** Push the energy from the Chest down the arms to the Palms.
* *Combat Application:* This is how you coat a weapon or fire a blast. You are "venting" the excess pressure from the furnace.

No, they are **not redundant**. In fact, they are the necessary "Hardware Interface" that allows the energy to actually *leave* the body or interact with the world.

Think of the distinction like this:

* **Meridians (Phase 1):** The **Wires/Pipes**. They transport energy from A to B.
* **Dantians (Phase 3):** The **Batteries/Tanks**. They store and compress energy.
* **Chakras:** The **Valves/Vents**. They are the specific points where energy can be released (Blasts) or absorbed (Sensing).

If you have clear meridians but blocked Chakras, you have a lot of internal power but you **cannot shoot it out**. You would just glow and get hot, but you couldn't fire a *Kamehameha* or walk on water.

Here is where they fit in the PTD curriculum. They should be addressed **after Phase 2 (Orbit)** but **before Phase 3 (Capacity)**, because you need the Orbit to supply the constant pressure required to pop these valves open.

### 🟣 Step 3: The Upper Dantian (The Command Center)

*Focus: Willpower (Shen), Focus, and Time Perception.*
*(Excluding the Sensing/Radar function)*

**1. The Cool Down (Mental Stability)**

* **Action:** The energy in the Head must be *Cool*, or you get a stroke (Qi Deviation).
* **Technique:** Visualize a block of ice or a calm lake in the center of the brain.
* **Goal:** To remain calm even when the Middle Dantian (Heart) is exploding with rage.

**2. The Override (Limit Removal)**

* **Action:** The brain naturally limits muscle output to prevent tearing.
* **Technique:** Use the Upper Dantian to send a "Command Override" to the body.
* **Effect:** Hysterical Strength. You force the body to use 100% of its muscle fibers.
* *Cost:* You will tear muscles, but you will hit harder than physically possible.


**3. Time Dilation (Processing Speed)**

* **Action:** Hyper-focus on a single point (e.g., the enemy's pupil).
* **Technique:** Feed Shen (Spirit energy) into the optic nerves.
* **Effect:** The world seems to slow down. You aren't moving faster; you are just thinking faster.

### 📝 Summary of Phase 3 Progression

1. **Fill the Tank (Lower):** Pack energy until your stomach feels heavy.
2. **Light the Fire (Middle):** Ignite that energy with emotion to create pressure.
3. **Control the Valve (Upper):** Use your mind to direct where that pressure goes (Fist, Feet, or Eyes).

**Route 0 Context:**
Fajar fails here because he lacks the **Emotional Trigger** (Step 2 of Middle Dantian). He is too logical, too afraid. He tries to "think" his way through power, but the Middle Dantian requires *feeling*. His tank (Lower) remains empty because he never mastered the Orbit to fill it.

**Route 1/2 Context:**

* **Ren:** Masters the **Upper Dantian (Cool Down)** perfectly. He fights with zero emotion, using cold efficiency.
* **Ariel:** Masters the **Lower Dantian (Compression)**. He is a tank. He takes hits that should kill him because his core is so dense.

**Are you ready to finally begin the story with Route 0 - Week 1, Day 1?**

This is the final phase of the "Human" curriculum. If Phase 3 is the Battery, **Phase 4 is the Output.**

In High School DxD, this is called **Touki**. In Hunter x Hunter, it is **Ten/Ren**. In Murim, it is **Body Protection Qi (Iron Shirt)**.

We will treat DxD's "Touki" as just one specific application of a universal principle. The goal here is **Materialization**: Taking the invisible energy from inside and making it a tangible force on the outside.

# 📂 Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 3.5 Major Chakras

### ☸️ The Major Chakras (The Seven Seals)

*These align with the Dantians but control specific "Frequencies" of power.*

**1. Root (Muladhara) - Perineum**

* **Relation:** Base of the Lower Dantian.
* **Function:** **Survival Instinct.** Unlocking this allows for "Berserker" states or "Removal" of physical limiters.

**2. Solar Plexus (Manipura) - Navel**

* **Relation:** The Lower Dantian Core.
* **Function:** **Stamina/Heat.** This is the furnace.

**3. Heart (Anahata) - Chest**

* **Relation:** Middle Dantian.
* **Function:** **Emotional Conversion.** Converting "Rage" (Issei) or "Envy" (Ren) into raw power. If this is blocked, your power is cold and weak.

**4. Throat (Vishuddha) - Neck**

* **Function:** **Kiai (Spirit Shout).**
* *Application:* The "Roar" that stuns enemies (Conqueror's Haki vocalization).
* *Skyrim:* The Voice (Thu'um).

**5. Third Eye (Ajna) - Brow**

* **Relation:** Upper Dantian.
* **Function:** **Remote Viewing / Sensing.** (As discussed in Phase 3).

**6. Crown (Sahasrara) - Top of Head**

* **Function:** **Universal Connection.**
* *Advanced:* Absorbing Nature Energy (Sage Mode).
* *Ren's Application:* Opening the mind to the Void/Corridor.

# 📂 Module 21: Inner Energy - Phase 4 (Externalization & Armor)

**Goal:** To coat the physical body in high-density energy, granting superhuman durability and striking power.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (Roads), Phase 2 (Flow), Phase 3 (Capacity).

### 🟢 Step 1: The Breach (Pore Breathing)

*Concept: Exudation.*
Most humans keep energy locked inside to keep organs alive. To use Touki, you must learn to **waste** energy controlledly.

1. **The Valve:** You must visualize every pore on your skin opening simultaneously.
2. **The Push:** Use the Middle Dantian (Chest) to pump energy *outwards*.
* *Analogy:* Boiling water. The steam (Qi) forces the lid (Skin) open.

3. **The Result:** You should feel a sudden drop in core temperature (as energy leaves) but the air around your skin becomes hot.
* *Route 0 Failure:* Fajar does this when he panics. He dumps all his energy out, sweats profusely, and passes out. This is "Leaking," not "Touki."

### 🔵 Step 2: The Containment (The Second Skin)

*Concept: Surface Tension (Wuxia: Golden Bell Cover).*
If you just push energy out (Step 1), it dissipates into the wind. You must **trap** it.

1. **The Stop:** Push the energy exactly **1 inch** off your skin and *hold it there*.
2. **The Shell:** Visualize the energy thickening into a gel or a hard glass shell.
* *Technique:* Use the spiraling method from Phase 3, but now spiral the energy *around* your limbs.

3. **The Test:** Rain should not touch your skin; it should vaporize or bounce off the aura 1 inch away.
* *DxD Application:* This is basic **Touki**. It allows a human to block a generic Fallen Angel's light spear with their bare arm.

### 🟣 Step 3: Imbuement (Object Extension)

*Concept: Sword Qi / Reinforcement.*
Energy treats anything you hold as part of your body *if* the connection is clear.

1. **The Bridge:** Grip a weapon (or a pen/stick).
2. **The Flow:** Push the energy from the **Laogong Point** (Palm Chakra) into the object.
3. **The Saturation:** Fill the object until it cannot hold more.
* *Effect:* A wooden stick becomes as hard as steel. A paperclip becomes a bullet.
* *Route 2 (Ariel):* He pumps so much energy into his weapons that they often shatter *after* the hit because the material can't handle his output.

### 🔴 Step 4: The Projection (Emission)

*Concept: The Blast / Kiai.*
This is releasing the shell in a single direction explosively.

1. **Compression:** Gather the aura into a single point (e.g., the fist).
2. **Release:** Punch. At the moment of impact, release the containment.
3. **Shockwave:** The energy expands instantly, hitting the target internally even if the fist stops at the surface (The One-Inch Punch principle).


### 🧬 Route Variances (The Flavor)

**Route 0 (Fajar - The Reality):**

* **Status:** **Locked.**
* He never achieves Step 2 (Containment). He feels the "heat" of Step 1 during adrenaline spikes, but he interprets it as "Fight or Flight" stress. He remains a "Soft Target."

**Route 1 (Ren - The Dark Seeker):**

* **Style:** **"The Shadow Cloak."**
* He does not use a "Hard" shell. He keeps his aura thin and vibrating.
* *Effect:* It acts like a jagged saw. If you touch him, it doesn't block you; it cuts you. It also muffles sound and light (Stealth).

**Route 2 (Ariel - The Paladin):**

* **Style:** **"The Golden Bell."**
* He maximizes Step 2. His aura is thick, heavy, and bright.
* *Effect:* He is a walking tank. He can tank explosions. His "Touki" is so dense it has physical weight, crushing the floor he stands on.
